# Ohmmeter
dotted line = DC
tilde = AC
## Voltmeter
red -> V ohm
black -> COM

in parallel with resistor

## Ammeter
black -> COM
red -> mA

1. **cut the circuit**
2. connect ammeter in series

# Breadboard
power to red line
reference/ground to green line

use alligator clips & wire if necessary

make sure power is off when making circuit
