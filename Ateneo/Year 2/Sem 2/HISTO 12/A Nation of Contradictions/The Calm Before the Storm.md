Andres Bonifacio after the Tejeros Convention signaled the shift of revolutionary leadership from urban middle class to rural middle class led by Emillio Aguinaldo.
While the Katipuneros were resolving leadership issues within the revolution, the Spanish increased their forces. About 40,000 fresh troops led by Fernando Primo de Rivera launched an offensive to capture Cavite. The leader of the revolution retreated to Montalban.
The leaders of the revolution regrouped in San Miguel, Bulacan, and established the Biak-na-Bato republic.
Filipinos continued the struggle against the Spanish, and established provisional governments allied to Aguinaldo.

Revolutionaries in Padni, Bulacan established the republic of Real de Kakarong de Sili. Western and central Visayas also formed the federal states of the Visayas.

Primo de Rivera tasked an illustrado, Pedro Paterno, to mediate between the Spanish and Filipino forces in Biak-na-Bato. Aguinaldo and Paterno led to the Pact of Biak-na-Bato. This agreement aimed to end the revolution and address the concerns of the revolutionaries.

## Major provisions of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato
### Implementation of reforms
The Spanish colonial government agreed to implement reforms addressing Aguinaldo's demands. They promised to increase government offices available to Filipinos, reduce tributo (tribute) from the populace, and end the policy of polo y Servicio (forced labor). Freedom of the press and secularization of the parishes were not addressed.
### Voluntary exile of the leaders of the Biak-na-Bato Republic
Aguinaldo and key members of the revolution were exiled to the British colony Hong Kong. Primo de Rivera's nephew accompanied the revolutionaries as hostage until the Spaniards paid reparations and implemented reforms.

The Spanish colonial government promised to pay Aguinaldo and his group 800,000 Mexican dollars in three installments. $MXN 400,000 will be given upon Aguinaldo's departure from Biak-na-Bato. $MXN 200,000 will be paid when the revolutionaries surrends 800 arms. $MXN 200,000 will be given when the arms surrendered amounted to 1,000 pieces, and the Te Deum was played in the Cathedral in Manila as thanksgiving for the restoration of peace.
