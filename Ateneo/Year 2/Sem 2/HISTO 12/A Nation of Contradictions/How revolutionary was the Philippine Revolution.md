# Features of the revolution
## Not "plebian"
Member of educated and employed "middle class." More than half of those present at the Cry of Balintawak had positions in the colonial bureaucracy. Others  were printers, merchants, and teachers.

## Liberal in orentiation
A lot in common with ilustrados, and some of the earliest members were in this class. Both were influenced by Spanish liberalism.
None had links with millenarian colorum sects, but these colorums would come to appropriate aspects of the Katipunan later on.
Katipunan liberalism were seen by symbols of Freemasonry and the French Enlightenment rather than the rituals of the Catholic Church of folk epics like the Pasyon.

## No goal beyond "unity" for the sake of overthrowing Spain
The Katipunan sought the formation of a "unified, compact, vigorous and homogeneous body that would become a new sovereign nation."

## Suppressing social categories
The goal of "unity" mean suppressing differences: ethnic, class, regional, and religious.
Katipunan documents do notmention social categories as they primarly aimed at **regime change** not social change.
No program for addressing social inequities, only for intituting legal equality in within the terms of Spanish civil law.
It did not furnish a theory and analysis of social conflicts, merely urging members to lead virtuous lives, a la Rizal.
The Katipunan never planned to redistribute land or demoratize social relations.
It's aims were limited to replacing Spaniards with Filipinos, and merely limiting the Church's power by neutralizing the influence of Spanish friars.

## Intra-class conflict
Bonifacio was executing for plotting a coup as Aguinaldo became president of the Revolutionary Republic.
However, no sharply divergent ideologies were at stake. The Magdiwang and Magdalo members easily shifted as practical needs determined their alliance.
Nearly everyone deserted Bonifacio, even his most trusted followers.

## Inter-class conflict after revolution
With the return of Aguinaldo from exile and the reformation of the Republic in Malolos, peasant groups began engaging in guerrilla warfare insisting on their rights.
They found themselves faced with the Republic's attempts to raise funds by imposing new and old taxes—poll taxes, sales taxes, taxes for transporting goods, for selling them, for buying them, etc.

After initially ending forced labor, the Republic restored it to draft men into militias. This removed men from their fields, resulting in economic disaster.
The Republic sought to secure support of provincial elites by promising them friar lands. They thus initiated a period of land-grabbing.
They also sought to float a National Loan, mortgaging assets of the country to wealthy ilustrados for loans to finance fights. This was interrupted, however, by the US invasion and the fall of the Republic.

Congress was unable/unwilling to stop abuse of its military force. The volunteer forces relied on donations and pillaging. They stole food and money, engaged in rape, and other violations.
The Republic responded through brutal military repression–like colonial powers.

## Peasantry conflict
Peasant armies emerged to fight the Republic.
Rail workers, tobacco workers, and domestic servants fought for their rights.
Pensacola brothers in Zambales: "it was time for the rich to become poor,and the poor to be rich."
Peasants groups attacked government offices and burned documents; harassed and attacked tax collectors; squatted on hacienda lands; and set up communes such as the Guardia de Honor or the Santa Iglesia around Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Pampanga.
Some groups formed new katipunans in the mountains of Sierra Madre, like Macario Sakay. Suviving meant raiding surrounding haciendas for supplies.
These groups were seen as a threat to the Republic.

## Different leadership, same ideals
The leaders of the Republic were wealthy ilustrados alongside elite leadership of the Katipunan.
Both agreed on the essentials of a liberal social order. The nation was to be ruled by the wealthiest and most learned people, while the power of local elites – who owed their position to Spanish colonialism – would be preserved and expanded.

There was no intent to redistribute wealth or progressive taxation. No social leveling, only protection and enhancement of privileges.
The Republic was more concerned with international recognition than local legitimization.

The US occupying forces pursued the same program, who kept the Republic alive. They establish the first national colonial legislature called the Philippine Assembly, nearly every member part of the Malolos Republic.
The Americans purchased lands from the Vatican, and sold them to the landed elites.

## How revolutionary?
Filipino nationalist in the Propaganda Movement, the Katipunan, and the Republic were inspired by Spanish liberalism rather than anarchism.
They were desired unity and to rule the country for their benefit, assuming the country wanted the same. They assumed what was good for the elites was good for the masses, regardless of social background.
They prioritized rule of private property alongside formal legal and racial equality with the Spaniards, and the Americans.
They did not desire socio-economic equality of those below them.

# Unlike the French
Nothing like the French revolution. There was no regicide nor mass slaughter of Spaniards.
Only a tiny number of friars were executed, and to the reluctance of leaders and the common people.
There was great continuity between the Filipino colonial elite and those who governed in the revolutionary era, as well as under US occupation.

# Like the US
The US revolution was spearheaded by conservative white men, many of whom owned slaves, in order to "have an empire of our own."
This empire emerged through theft of Indian lands and genocide of natives.
To preserve unity of the Republic, they kept slavery, a crucial element of US capitalism. They created a Republic where white males woud be legally equal to pursue liberty and happiness indissociable from the accumulation of property.

The Philippine Revolution was led by creole, mestizo and indio elites, aiming at unity in order to preserve the structures of colonial rule.
