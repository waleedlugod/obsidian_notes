Filomeno Aguilaar

September 15, 1898: Revolutionary Congress convened to write Philippines constitution, written by Apolianrio Mabini.
June 12, 1898: declaration of independence

Most energetic debate was over church and state relations.
The meeting was within Barsoain Church, converted to a state legislative arena, adorned with Philippine flags

In Europe, no separation of church and state. Still, most of Northern Europe transitioned into variants of Protestantism.
The Philippine discussion of separation is relatively early in global history, with the exception of the US and Mexico.

Despite the spread of rationalization, religious pluralism, and dominance of the state in social life, the linear development of separation of church and state is ahistorical.
Relations of church and state is diverse: theocracy, state with official religion, friendly, indifferent, hostile separation.

The separation occurred due to imperialism, not a native process of structural social change, absent of imperial forces.

# Malolos: An Overview
Two drafts were received: Mabini (inspired by Spanish constitution); Pedro Paterno (Spanish constitution as well; actually written by Ricardo Regidor).
The Spanish constitution of 1869 (considered liberal; product of the Glorious Revolution that deposed Isabella II. Isabella implemented economic reforms in the Philippines [[(L) Propaganda Movement and the Philippine Revolution]]) upheld the principle of a national religion, but permitted other religions.
Mabini's draft declared religious freedom and disavowed any state religion.

Most delegates (according to Calderón) liked Paterno, but disliked Mabini. Mabini acted to present Paterno's draft to Congress, but then prepared a different document, which he claimed to have patterned after the Costa Rica constiution.

Calderón's draft was submitted and approved with modifications, but not without opposition by "Mabini's partisans" as Calderón refers.
Debate on religion of Calderón's draft, Title 3, was deferred until last.

Native elites' opinions were extreme and varied: absolute adherence; total repudiation of the Catholic Church; those antifriar were loyal to the church.

Tomás del Rosario, Felix Ferrer, M. del Rosario, Arcadio del Rosario, and Cecilio Hilario introduced an amendment reducing Title 3 from three articles to one.
	"The State recognizes the freedom and equality of all religions, as well as the separation of the Church and the State"
The debate was polarized on this proposal.

Church-state relations debates resumed on November 22. Two day later, Calderón continued his arguments, not without "interruptions" by Tomás del Rosario.

On November 29, delegates would vote on the issue. Supporters of church-state unity were confident in their numbers. The votes would be cast by a secret ballot.

The moment when casting would take place, the delegates against unity, entered the hall, headed by Antonio Luna. The result was a tie with 25 votes each side.
Notably, Pedro Paterno did not cast his vote.
A second round of voting ensued. Pablo Tecson, who previously abstained, broke the tie, enabling church-state separation by one vote.

# The Principal Contenders
Scholars dismissed Calderón's advocacy or church-state unity as due to his conservatism.
Majul desribed Calderón as:
	"typical Filipino conservatives, weaned and educated by the Mother Church."
Agoncillo is described as:
	"Whether Calderon was aware of it or not, the fact that he was a grandson of a Spanish friar probably militated against his impulse to provide for religious equality. Here the conservative mind, deeply rooted in the marriage of Church and State, came to the surface and protruded like a buoy swaying i all direction but unable to free itself from its anchorage."

Calderón had "intimate relations" with the Jesuits who taught him at Ateneo Municipal (he got his law degree from UST). He also "collaborated closely" with Fr. Mariano Sevilla, who had been exiled in 1872.

Like other ilustrados, Calderón was very antifriar. He believed that "conciliation with Spain was already impossible." He desired the withdrawal of Spanish governors; secularization; to break up monastic estates to sell.

Both sides of the debate were in opposition to Spanish friars, but adherence to Masonry separated unionists from separatists.
It was remarked that some separatists were Masons, who were in contact with Spanish liberal movements. The implication is they had direct experience and relations with the issue. Among these were Tomás del Rosario and Arcadio del Rosario.

However, Masonry had inspired an imagined community alternative proposed by Tomás del Rosario.

Ilustrados regarded Masonry as a society in oppositions to friars, agents of a political order. Friars were also seen as political agents of the colonial state.
# Catholicism and the Nationalist Movement
Calderón's support of church-state unity pays homage to the secularization issue, and the martyrdom of José Burgos, Mariano Gómez, and Jacinto Zamora ([[(L) Propaganda Movement and the Philippine Revolution]]).
Recognizing Catholicism as the state religion, the revolution would pay respect to the pioneers of the nationalism movement, martyrs of secularization.
He views religious freedom as historically absurd and politically inappropriate for the 
Philippines.

The native clergy gave rise to Filipino nationalism.

Leaders of the Propaganda Movement, while being vehemently antifriar, did not deprecate the Catholic Church, recognizing the native appropriate of Catholicism as their personal religion.
They were at war with the friars, not the Church itself.
Del Pilar's letters suggested the struggle against friars were for the Benefit of Spain and the Church.
Graciano Lopez Jaena gave a speech at Ateneo Barcelonés that they were opposing the friars not for or against religion.
Rizal corrected himself, mistaking attacks on the abuses of friars on Catholicism.

Patranato Real, which sponsored missionary work in Spanish colonies in exchange for deciding ecclesiastical personnel and dispositin of local church's revenues, could not be questioned by the nationalists given their stance. The Patranato Real underpinned church-state unity.

When Rizal was deported to Mindanao, Del Pilar noted that national integrity is distinguished from religion; the religious diversity within Philippines; and that religion was not the basis for social cohesion. However, he did not explicitly question the need for a state religion.

Once the friars were expelled, it was assumed that secular priests would take their place, keeping their social disposition identical to colonial society.

For the ilustrados, "Filipino" were exclusively the Catholicized and Europeanized native elites. For Calderón, freedom of religion would create division among the "Filipinos", and Catholicism served as the social glue.

# Calderón’s Proposal on Church–State Unity
## Articles
5:
	"The nation protects the worship and the ministers of the Roman Catholic Apostolic religion, which is the religion of the State, and does not use its revenues to contribute to the expenses of any other form of worship."
Catholicism is the "religion of the State" whose personnel would be protected by the state.

6:
	"Any other form of worship may be practiced privately, provided that it is not contrary to morality and good custom and does not imperil the safety of the nation."
Religious freedom, or rather, tolerance of other religions.

7:
	"The appointment to and performance of all work and positions in the republic, as well as the payment of civil and political dues, are independent of the religion of Filipinos."
To clarify to Article 5,  the state is autonomous and not subordinated to the Church. However, the Church is dependent upon the state for support.

The relationship of Church and state can be interpreted as putting the state above the church.

Mandated respect for other religions opposed the state's directive to missionize remote communities.
This proposal may be seen as a reaffirmation of the status quo.
# Filipinization: The Native Clergy as Heir to Power
Proponents of church-state unity in Malolos wanted to expand the Filipinization of parishes to the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. They felt it was deserved out of self-sacrifice, necessity, or birthright.

Calderón believed an official church can be used tactically to name the heads of religious orders. Otherwise, the Vatican can name foreign bishops and disregard native clergy.
He also believed that monastic properties would remain in the Philippines than siphoned to the Vatican, assuming they are loyal.
Calderón felt the country was in a position to negotiate a concordat with the Vatican.

An additional article was appended at the last minute:
	"All the estates, edifices, and other property possessed by the religious corporations in these islands shall be deemed restored to the Philippine State as of May 24, 1898 when the Dictatorial Government has been constituted in Cavite."
This attempts to address the issue that a lot of money is going to into the treasury of religious corporations.
US imperial rule sold off friar lands in exchange for a hefty compensation.

Mabini, despite opposing church-state unity, was behind the concept of a national church.

The Patronato Real allowed friar orders to thrive in Spanish Philippines. Friars sought to make themselves useful to the state, developing excessive patriotism (españolismo).
The Spanish authorities then treated clergy as employees of the state.
Aguinaldo sought an enforcement of a national church based on this model.
# Debating Church–State Relations
Debate returned in late November 1899.
Tomás del Rosario explained his case for five hours.
When Calderón made his presentation, but not without "interruptions" by Tomás del Rosario.

According to Teodoro Agoncillo, the Calderon group was accused of being stooges of the friars. The accusation implied they were traitors to the Revolution.

Tomás del Rosario differentiated Christianity in theory and in practice, naming the present religion as theocratic feudalism.
Manuel Gómez distinguished human frailties from the tenants of the faith.

Manuel Gómez argued that priests sough the good of humanity, and with church-state untion, evil would be restrained by two forces: internally through religion and externally through the state.
Acadio del Rosario argued that countries with and without a state religion did not have a significant difference in crime statistics.

Keeping in mind that friars interfered with the affairs of the state, unionists argued that the native clergy would not behave the same due to their patriotism.
Separatists did not consider nationality. Acardio del Rosario argued that native clergy would eventually end up as tyrants.

The debate was a stalemate.

Since the question was loaded with emotional baggage, separationists highlighted European history, pivoting around the Papacy.

# Separationists and the Papacy
Tomás del Rosario argued on the historical distrust of the Papacy.

Tomás del Rosario presented how the Pope would act despotically, referencing the ambitions of Rome and the Pontificate.
He referenced the Crusades as impelled by "religious fanaticism", proclaiming the Papacy as the "ruler of the world".
He discussed how the Reformation annihilated the Roman church and prcolaimed "the liberty of the human conscience".
His point was to suggest the Philippines should seize the opportunity brought about by the wars in Europe which liberated them from Roman control. To do otherwise was regressive, returning to the Medieval Ages.

Acardio del Rosario spoke of the "genuine tolerance" that prevailed, which would be reversed with a state religion.

# The Catholic Clergy and the Deferment of Separation
Gregorio Aglipay played a curcial role in persuading Mabini to suspend the amendment.

Aglipay was appointed Vicario General Castrense by Aguinaldo.

Aglipay convinced the Filipino clergy that the revolutionary government had pure intentions for the Church, meriting their cooperation as noncooperation could impel the government to adopt separation.

After the triumph of church-state separation, Filipino priests petitioned Aguinaldo to preserve the Church's position, and veto the Congress's decision.

The vexations caused by the separation compelled Mabini to advocate for its suspension despite previously advocating for it.
Mabini warned Aguinaldo that the fallout of a definite decision would destabilize the government
The government needed the cooperation of the clergy to secure independence.

Mabini, as prime minister, postponed implementing the amendment until "official recognition of our Independence" because:
1. constitutional guarantees could not be sustained when military dominance is necessary;
2. openly establishing separation of Church and State would cause a withdrawal from those who support the State religion.

Aglipay's suppoters established a national church a year later in Paniqui, Tarlac, and declared itself independent of the Spanish ecclesiastical hierarchy, confirmed allegiance to Rome, and vowed to not accept foreign bishops without approval from native priests.

Aglipay was sentenced in April 29, 1899. He was excommunicated for "usurpation of authority".
The government still supported Aglipay.

Aglipay's position and the Filipinization of the Catholic Church was undermined by the church-state separation.
However, appointing Aglipay indicated Aguinaldo and Mabini's desire to ignore the outcome of the vote.
The actions of the top leadership modeled a state religion.
Many local government officials interfered with religious practices of natives. Aguinaldo sought to safeguard the rights of the clurgy.

# Conclusion: Conflicting Visions of National Community
Supporters of church-state unity wanted to build a state with Filipino Catholicism as its foundation. They desired to merge the imagined egalitarian community within a definite border, and the hierarchical, global Catholic ecumene. This merge was seen as unproblematic as religion served as a social glue.
This unity was at the expense of non-Catholics.
They supported an exclusive community that sought to do justice of the history of Filipino nationalism.

Separatists recognized the plurality of Filipino beliefs and inclusive of indigenous religious traditions. Their imagined heterogeneous community justified religious freedom and pluralism.
This diminished the Catholic Church. Separatists help a distrust in the Church's officialdom, symbolized by the Papacy.
They sought to undermine ecclesiastical power because of their experience with the colonial Spanish church, and insistence of a secular state free from Roman interference.
A Filipinized church was not viewed highly either as they considered the church prone to abuse regardless of nationality. However, in doing so, they negated the history of the Filipino nationalist movement; they valued European history more than their own.
They supported a community that made no connection to the struggle of the secularization movement.

# Epilogue: The Imposition of Separation
The question remained essentially unresolved.
For the sake of political convenience, church-state unity was maintained.

US colonial policy on church-state separation wa enunciated on July 6, 1900 by Major General Elwell Stephen Otis.
However, the US policy, to the confusion of separationists, favored friars.
The extended protection to the church was based on "friendly" separation in the US. Separationists viewed this stance has "hostile".

The Catholic Church was disestablished; priests no longer held government positions; the state had no authority to make appointments in the ecclesiastical hierarchy; Protestants were free to proselytize and establish their own churches.
The US viewed the discontent of friar estates as the cause of the revolution, and insisted a redistribution of these properties. An agreement was signed in December 1903 to the benefit of wealthy Filipinos. Friar orders lost their powerbase in the Philippine countryside.

Spain's loss of Philippines suggested the cessation of the Patronato Real. The Vatican refused to withdraw the friars, but informally agreed with the US for their voluntary expatriation.

The friar population was reduced to 246 by December 1903, and Spanish clergy was replenished with American and European clergy.

US intervention and agreement with the Vatican ensured Filipinization of the Catholic Church would not occur.
The Catholic Church was largely a colonial institution. The natives resented the appointment of American bishops.
