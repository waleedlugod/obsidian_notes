Malolos Republic: First Philippine Republic
After the end of the Filipino revolution against Spanish rule, the Malolos Republic aimed to  resolve contradictions of Philippine society, and to the path of kalayaan.
The Republic had to compromise between the radical visions of the Revolution and conservative Philippine society. This module aims to look how the Malolos Republic attempted to solve these problems, and how the compromises of the past set the 20th century Filipino experience.
