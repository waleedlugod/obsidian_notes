Patronato Real: Spain has control over church affairs; the church will establish colonies in exchange for power for the State to appoint people in the parishes

Unity:
* Allow secularization;
* Unifying force for Filipinos; non-Christians are excluded;

Separation:
* No proper secularization due to dissolved Patronato Real;
* Ensure the mistakes of Spanish colonialism is not repeated; no encroachment of the state on the Church; a liberal republic could not be established;

Mabini:

# Government Fund
colonial taxation will be eliminated
war tax imposed; convince masses to join army since soldiers have no tax
most rich are part of the military; masses shoulder annual tax

loans; government will be indebted to the rich; the rich also pass the laws
friar land
national loan = friar lands passed to the rich instead to peasantry as intended
aguinaldo opposed loan; mabini fired; paterno hired; loan passed nonetheless since paterno proposed it

# Peasantry conflict
tax + national loan
military against peasantry

# US Occupation
white mans burden
white love
