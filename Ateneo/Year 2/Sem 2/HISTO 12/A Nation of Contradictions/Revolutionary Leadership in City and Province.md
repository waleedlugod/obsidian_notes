# Katipunan
The general consensus of the Katipunan was of their lowly character. Isabelo de los Reyes, the first Filipino historian o the Katipunan, said that the revolutionary association was a "plebian society," whose members "belonged to the workmen and peasant classes" and among whose founders "there was not a single rich man, nor one of a learned profession."
This sense of distaste later transitioned to more approvingly, presenting the insurrection as a salutary popular reaction against ilustrado gradualism and prevarication. This sentiment formed the central theme of Teodoro Agoncillo's *The Revolt of the Masses*, which is generally accepted as the most authoritative study of the subject. He writes the "middle class" had proven themselves "the bulwark of the Spanish reactionary party", too concerned with their own position, and too cautious to make real impact on colonial rule.
Their failure to provide effective leadership, inability to understand the common people's aspirations, and their snobish aloofness won "the hatred of the masses".
The sentiment of the Katipuneros, were that "where there are learned men everything is brought to naught by discussions."

Observing that the Katipunan had been organized from the lower class, many ilustrados felt that the revolutionaries departed from the enlightenment liberalism of the propagandist. The comments by Isabelo de los Reyes that the goal of the Katipunan was a "communistic republic", and Felipe Calderon on the "socialistic" character of the association, set the historical orthodoxy.
Agoncillo writes the Katipunan was "fundamentally a mass idea based on utopian socialism." Although the "middle class" wanted to preserve their privileged position in Philippine life, the masses wanted to over throw the existing social order, symbolized by the Katipunan. According to agoncillo, the association aims to abolish cacique power through agrarian reform, and establish economic democracy.

These sentiments have caused confusion and a distorted view of the Katipunan. Although the mass character of the revolution has been taken as evidence of a socialistic nature, they are essentially **distinct**.

# Leadership of Katipunan
Proponents of the thesis that the insurrection was organized by the lowest class often cite Andres Bonifacio, who was of urban middle class.

He was the first of six children of Santiago Bonifacio, a tailor, and Catalina de Castro, a Spanish mestiza, he was born in the district of Tondo in 1863. Andres attended private tutors, and was provided sound elementary education. He was orphaned 14, and started working.

Bonifacio married Gregoria de Jesus, the daughter of a gobernadorcillo. Her father was reluctant to the marriage since Bonifacio was a freemason, and therfore an enemy of the Church. Freemasons were also men of substance and education, inconsistent of the view of Bonifacio as a plebian. Bonifacio was also a founding member of La Liga Filipina, an association for the "study and application of reforms", also founded by Rizal, himself a mason. According to Agoncillo, it "personified the middle class" and exempted the "unlettered masses".

However, Bonifacio did not experience the true ilustrado status by his unfinished schooling.

Teodoro Plata, first cousin of Gregoria de Jesus, joined Bonifacio in founding Katipunan. They formed the first "triangle" with Ladislao Diwa. Diwa enrolled into Law at UST, where he met Bonifacio, distributing propaganda to students. Bonifacio later served as Katipunan president when he sought to systematize recruitment to the association, including the formation of district branches known as popular councils.

Pio Valenzuela attended UST, and was a fourth year medical student when he joined the Katipunan. Emilio Jacinto also attended UST, became the closest of all Bonifacio's associates, and the association's leading publicist and theoretician.

None of the most prominent Manila-based Katipuneros were classified as typically proletarian, but occupied intermediate positions. These positions especially brought them into direct contact with the institutions, policies and representatives of Spanish colonial rule.

Students who attended UST felt that the education provided was anachronistic despite the prestige attached.

Many leadership were principalia or worked for them as secretaries and interpreters.

# Social structure
Principalia administered the affairs of each town and outlying settlements. Their origins can be traced to pre-Spanish community leaders whose authority were recognized by colonizers, and utilized as the cornerstone for indirect rule.
At the bottom of the bereauracy were the cabeza e barangay, and had direct ilnk between the government and people. They had jurisdiction over a barrio, and collected taxes, first as tribute and later as cedula payment. They were in charge of assigning adult males to local public work projects to meet the requirement of rendering 40 days of labor.
Until 1893, cabezas alone constituted the principalia, and by indirect election, chose one of their own to be a gobernadorcillo, known as capitan municipal after 1890.

Gobernadorcillos supervise and coordinate the work of cabezas on top of additional responsibilities. They were assigned to maintain peace & order; exercise judicial authority in petty cases; administer postal service; upkeep of local jail; provide needs for travellers; and ensure inhabitants had good employment and good Catholics.
Governadorcillos appointed assistants. Some of these were part of tenientes mayores, principales, designated to look after police matters, boundaries of land and branding of livestock; a corp sof cuadrilleros, constables staffed among townsmen; and a directorcillo, a person with some college education and knowledge of Spanish.

# Cavite
Emilio Aguinaldo was a man of substance who served as a gobernadorcillo multiple times, and played a leading role in the Katipunan. He became a cabeza de barangay at 17 and served for 8 years, later succeeding his brother Crispulo as capitan municipal. He joined the Katipunan the same year, and took the nom de guerre of Magdalo.

Once the guardia civil has been cleared, the Magdalo council was reorganized as a sub-provincial insurgent government, headed by a cabinet. Bladomero Aguinaldo, cousin of Emilio, was elected as Magdalo president. He attended Ateneo Municipal and UST. 

Candido Tirona (later provoked Andres Bonifacio in Tejeros convention [[Propaganda Movement and the Philippine Revolution]]), one of Aguinaldos' principal associates and chief rival of the Aguinaldos, was acclaimed as Emilio's successor, under revolutionary conditions, as capitan municipal. Tirona was also appointed Minister of War in Magdalo.

Vito Belarmino, a third member of the Magdalo Cabinet in addition to Crispulo and Emilio, had experiece of the senior office of pueblo government, having held the post of gobernadorcillo in Silang. Belarmino's formal education was cut short due to outbreaks of cholera. Prior to being a governadorcillo he served as a cabeza and secretary of the tribunal.

Principales and men of similar social position dominated the leadership of Magdiwa, the early Katipunan council acting as the sub-provincial insurgent government in western Cavite.

Elected Magdiwang president was Mariano Alvarez, capitan municipal of Noveleta. His accension to municipal office was virtually a matter of family tradition.

A number of Magdiwan leaders were linked by kinship. Santiage and Pascual Alvarez, son and nephew of Mariano, were Magdiwang General-in-Chief and Secretary-general respectively. Two brothers, Emiliano and Mariano Riego de Dios, both with extensive formal education, were Minister of Commerce and Brigadier-General respectively.

Completing the Magdiwang cabinet were Aristno Villanueva, past gobernadorcillo of Noveleta, as Minister of War; Mariano Trias, a sugar planter and graduate of Letran, as Minister of Welfare and Justice; and Diego Mojica as Minister of Finance.

Bonifacio's career depended largely upon his ability to carry out orders: Agunaldo's class matrix demanded that he give them.
