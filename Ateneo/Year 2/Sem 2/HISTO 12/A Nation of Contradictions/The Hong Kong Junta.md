The pact of Biak-na-Bato ([[The Calm Before the Storm]]) represented the military stalemate. Although the pact fostered a temporary truce, Spanish and Filipino forces still clashed on the ground.
Most revolutionaries did not trust the Spaniards and buried their weapons instead of surrendering them. The colonial government similarly believed that Aguinaldo was merely bidding for time, and planned to return and renew the Revolution.
The mutual distrust naturally meant the failure of the Pact.

After arriving to Hong Kong, Aguinaldo met with Filipinos exiled after the 1872 Cavite Mutiny. Together they organized a Junta functioning as a revolutionary government in exile.
The "Hong Kong Junta" planned to use the reparation payments to purchase arms from Japan for a revolution in case Spaniards failed to implement promised reforms. To prevent this, the Spanish government halted all payments until the Katipunans that refused to surrender voluntarily dissolved. The Junta the repudiated the Pact.

Aguinaldo distanced himself from the Junta to allow negotiation of new terms. With his secratary and Gregorio del Pilar, Aguinaldo left Hong Kong for Singapore. With Spain embroiled in a war with the United States, talks of reconciliation was halted, and Aguinaldo was encouraged to return to Hong Kong and lead the Junta again.
