# The Function of the Institution of Authority or Government in Maintaining "Freedom" and Producing "Order" in Society
Mabini believed that society was a system of relations between people, associated to satisfy their needs through exchange ([[Asymmetrical Reciprocity]], [[Public Space and Political Public Sphere]]).

Mabini believed that people appropriated the products of the work of others, by force or deceit, resulting to a less of freedom, and lack of order. This can illustrate how Spain established sovereignty over the Philippines, and the US doing the same.
Mabini believed the right to the products of their labor is a natural one. The loss of this right implied the loss of freedom. This threat justified Mabini's necessity for an executive authority figure.

The person given this power is responsible to direct society, protect freedom, and administer justice as a representative of God (executive branch). This power is derived from the people.
Their power is justified in proportion to the overlap between the executive and the masses.
Tasked to coordinate the work of society into a harmonious system.

An elected agency must serve to check tyranny, and see that the elected authority uses their power in accordance to the people (legislative branch).

A power that determined the punishment for evil (judiciary branch).

# The "Welfare of the People" as an Aim of Government
Men had intrinsic capacities which ought to develop unhampered.
Freedom is a natural right, with God as its final source.

A State is a society that recognized natural rights, and a government to protect them.
These rights must be provided the favorable conditions (welfare of the people) to exist.

Mabini: "To govern is to study the needs and interpret the desired of  people, in order to fulfill the one and to satisfy the other." Welfare of the people = satisfaction for society's aspirations.

## Aspirations during the "Propaganda Period"
Rizal: "the right to life is inherent in every individual like the right to liberty and light."
Light: right to education and opportunity for doing so provided by the government.
Right to life: protection from arbitrary actions of colonial officials, and provided opportunities for socioeconomic well-being.

Man should not be a tool used by colonial powers.

Rizal: absence of freedom = tyranny. The people's native energies are stifled to the extent they are prevented from thinking the way they should. A man then cannot be properly a citizen.
It would not be morally just to punish someone who had not been granted these rights. It is unjust to punish someone for a crime they were driven to do.

Rizal's aspirations: right to dignity; not exposed to unnecessary humiliation.
Spanish government should provide better security and administration of justice.
Abuse of power had to be restricted.
Educational and economic status of the masses should be improved.
Filipino priests should be given better opportunities to hold parishes, excluding the friars.

Rizal demands when exiled to Dapitan:
1. Representation in the Spanish Cortes
2. Revamp of government administration in the country
3. Secularization
4. Primary education independent of friars
5. Freedom of press
6. Freedom of religion

People must be consulted to know their aspirations.
Rizal believed in direct consultation with the educated elite, not the masses.

Lopez-Jaena demaded liberty of conscience and association.
Security of the individual: absence of arbitrary arrests and exile and protection of the abuse of Guardia Civil.

Mariano Ponce asserted the failure of the Spanish government to satisfy these aspirations was the cause of opposition.
Leaders asserted that friars prevented the government from satisfying the major aspirations.

## Aspirations voiced by the "Katipunan"
Objectives according to Isabelo de los Reyes:
1. Separation from Spain if political right were not granted
2. Mutual help among members
3. Greater education and lessen religious fanticism

Propagandists maintained the illusion Spain would listen to their demands, Katipuneros prepared for revolution.

Majority of Katipunan members belonged to the uneducated masses.
They did not have plans for recognition of rights or administration.

Jacinto, considered the most educated, did not theorize on the function of government. He was content in the general definition of satisfaction via welfare.

## Aspirations expressed by the "Hong Kong Junta"
[[The Hong Kong Junta]]
Aspirations:
1. Freedom of though, press, association, religoin
2. Right to property
3. Suppression of Guardia Civil
4. No special privileges from the government
5. Greater election participation, and consultation on taxes
6. Protect industries.
7. Primary and higher education independent of religioun
8. All religious communities were to be subject to the Law

## Mabini's concept of the functions of government
According to Mabini, functions of government:
1. Personal security and liberties
2. Maximum satisfaction of economic wants
3. Best possible education

Mabini's Constitutional Program: bill of rights and educational provisions put into practice to the three functions of government.

Education was "one of the most powerful factors of social progress." Educations is a major responsibility of the State.

During Spanish regime, education was a monopoly of the religious orders.

Aspirations of Filipino leaders did not want radical differences.
