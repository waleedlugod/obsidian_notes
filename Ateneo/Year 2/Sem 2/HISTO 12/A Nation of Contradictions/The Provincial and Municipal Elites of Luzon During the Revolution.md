The emergence of local elites is a significant features of the political situation. The elites became the final arbiters of the direction of the Revolution.
Wealthy and educated Filipinos in office used the Revolution as a means to promote their interests.
Corruption characterized municipalities, exacerbating the grievances of the peasant masses.
Peasant movements were regarded as subversive by the Aguinaldo government. They were viewed as irrelevant to the drama in Manila, Kawit or Malolos.

The elites transferred their allegiance from Spanish colonial government to the Revolution as quickly from the Revolution to the US.

# The Revolution
Although the Biak-na-Bato leadership went to exile, the spirit of the revolution quickly spread.
"Bandit bands" which operated along Katipunan waged guerilla war against Spanish forces.
Katipunan and similar groups grew at a rapid pace.
In Zambales, the Katipunan operated by Teodoro and Doroteo Pansacula who advocated for common ownership of property and distribution of wealth from the rich to the poor. The rich labelled these people as robbers and cooperated with Spanish troops.

Guerilla resistance led by messianic peasant organizations—Cruz na Bituin and Santa Iglesia—promoted brotherhood and redistribution of land.
Santa Iglesia prophesied the Philippines would experience a social-levelling process. These beliefs threated the elite Kapampangans.
After joining forces sent by Aguinaldo, Kapampangan elite refused to recognize the local social revolution and sought to eliminate Santa Iglesia.

Many well-off Filipinos refused to join the Revolution during 1897-1898. Some allied themselves with Spain.
Spaniards felt confident that as long as Aguinaldo remains in exile, the colony would remain in their hands.

When news of the Spanish-American war reached the provinces, Aguinaldo's lieutenants offered their services to Basilio Agustin, the Spanish governor.
A Filipino militia was created, incorporating some of Aguinaldo's military leaders. The consultative assembly was created that included the highest Philippine elites, including Pedro Paterno.

Pedro Paterno, leader of the assembly, demanded autonomous government and representation in the Spanish Cortes. In exchange, the Filipinos would fight "side by side" with the Spaniards against the US.
During this time, Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines with the help of the US. Desperate for Filipino support, the governor accepted Paterno's demands.
On 13 June, Paterno demanded Spain to put their promises into effect. However, the colonial government was unwilling to kneel to the demands of the consultative assembly. Aguinaldo also declared independence a day before.

The elite's plan to gain autonomy under Spain was too late.
Spanish civil officials and residents concerned themselves with evacuating Manila.
The Spanish Guardia Civil was deserted by many.
Commanders of the Filipino militia deserted to Aguinaldo's camp.

Felipe Buencamino's defection signified the abandonment of the elite from Spanish government.
Buencamino still believed in the legitimacy of Spanish hegemony, and attempted to dissuade Aguinaldo's insurrection in Cavite. However, he also sent word to Manila that he "converted" to the revolutionary cause.

The US secretly negotiated with Spain for control over the Phlippines.
After a mock battle, Americans entered Manila.
Ilustrados were convinced the Revolution did not have the support of the US.

The political situation was still uncertain.
Aguinaldo had the support of the entire Tagalog region with the possibility to fight off the Americans.
Aware of the lack of talent among the active insurgent leaders, wealthy and educated Filipinos were invited to serve in Aguinaldo's government.

# Establishment of Local Government
Aguinaldo called for the reorganization of Philippine provincial and municipal government.
As far as Aguinaldo and Mabini were concerned, political reorganization was the ultimate outcome of the victory over Spain and the logical step after independence.
Reorganization would prove to foreign nations their capacity to govern themselves, and an avenue to pursue their revolutionary goals. Election would validate the Revolution, broaden the government, and legitimize Aguinaldo's leadership.
The elections, in effect, followed the liberation of the provinces.

Political reorganization was strongly affected by provincial elites.

In Manila, elections were felt his hesitance with the American occupation, yet urgency to shift the balance of power.
Aguinaldo appointed Ambrosio Flores  to expedite the process.
With concerns of conflict that would emerge from expression of authority, elections were suspended. Those elected into office were also ordered to refrain their activities until the American question was resolved.

Those elected used to be municipal captains under Spain.

Aguinaldo preferred underground governments, and approved an irregular election in Tondo by eight principales who chose among themselves the officials.
The group deplored the political climate and "could not live under the constituted authority of the legitimate government of the country." They were concerned with the lack of legitimate authority.
Aguinaldo conceded that the government would have to be organized appropriated.
Under the supervision of Leandro Ibarra, four Tondo principales chose themselves titles from random draw.
Aguinaldo called fora second election later after strong protests.

Political reorganization in Bikol was uneventful even after Aguinaldo's return.
When call to arms were sent from Cavite, they did not take action.
Only when American troops advanced towards Bikol did the Spanish community abandoned their posts and headed for Manila.

The day after the Spaniards left Legaspi, the committee summoned an assembly of principales of the capital, Legaspi, and Daraga.
In Catanduanes and Sorsogon, Spanish authorities transferred command to Bikolano leaders.
In Ambos Camarines, Bikolanos seized control and imprisoned Spaniards.
By the time General Lukban reached Camarines in early September 1898, the principales of Camarines and Albay almost finished establishing the basis for reorganization to deal with the political climate of Manila and Malolos.

By July 1898,  Spaniards in Iloilo were bracing for an American attack while defending against a plot organized by Roque Lopez and Pablo Araneta, whos members were part of the Spanish militia.
Hostilities erupted in November with the victory of the "conspirators," who established a provisional revolutionary government in November, with Roque Lopez as president and Vicente Franco as vice-president.
However, anti-Spanish sentiments were not present, and troops were even allowed to occupy the "neutral" town of La Paz as "guests" of the insurgent.
Iloilo was later effected when Spanish troops under de los Rios surrendered to the insurgents.

The Negros elite followed the same pattern of revolutionary organization.
Wealthy hacenderos established their own armies from peasants working in their estates.
Lopez encouraged Negrenses to coordinate with Iloilo, leading an increase in uprising.
The Spanish were then forced to forced to accede to to a capitulation, and a provisional government was established.

The elite of Western Visayas did not intend to recognize the supremacy of the Malolos Republic.
The Iloilo provisional revolutionary government changed its name to the Federal State of the Visayas, and envisioned itself equal to the Malolos Republic.
Leaders of Cebu also submitted the proceedings of their political reorganization to the Visayas government instead of Aguinaldo.

The Negros elite also did not recognize the Republic's supremacy.
Juan Araneta, appointed by Aguinaldo as politico-military governor of Negros, refused Aguinaldo's instruction to establish a provisional government as Negros already had a cantonal government.
Negrenses also refused to send delegates to the Malolos Congress when they convened in September 1898.

Ilustrados of Iloilo and Negros only approved the Republic when Americans arrived in Iloilo.
They declared that Visayas could not suvive under and independent Republic and needed the protection of the US. In reality, opposing the Americans would mean disaster for the Iloilo economy, and collaboration might bring material benefits.

Iloilo suffered great losses from the attack lead by General Martin Delgado, prompting the elite to negotiate with General Marcus Miller.
Insurgents of Iloilo then waged a hit-and-run resistance against the Americans while the provincial elite supported the Americans.

Led by Juan Araneta,four prominent hacenderos raised an American flag to negotiate with Miller, fearing Negros might suffer as well.
They were advised to confer with General Otis, given free transportation and soldiers to protect them and irregular Tagalog forces who began to instigate a rebellion.
The commission accepted the agreement to recognize American sovereignty, with the continuation of the Negros cantonal government in return, under the condition of American occupation.
Although the Negrenses were allowed to frame a constitution for their government, this was not taken seriously by either side.
The Negros elite accepted the agreement, happy they would be spared from the devastation effects of the Revolution seen in Luzon.

Filipino officials are now free from restricted imposed by the colonial regime and omnipresent censor of local administration by the friars.
Provisions were created that excluded all but ilustrados and principalia from voting, who also dominated the economic and political structures during the Spanish regime.
They chose among themselves the jefe local (municipal president) and three concillors (police and internal order; justice and civil registry; taxes and property).
Principalia were required to choose the cabeza for each barrio in the municipality.
The jefe local, three concillors, and cabeza constituted the town's junta magna (popular council).
The elected official were to elect among the principalia their representatives to the Congress in Malolos.
Reorganization followed the centralized pattern of administration of the Spanish regime. However, the provincial governor, councillors, and delegates to the Congress were given much more complex duties mirroring their municipal counterparts.

# Challenges to Elite Dominance
 The structure and function of the provincial and municipal governments of Aguinaldo's reorganization plan was patterned after the colonial reforms of 1893.
 The June 18 decree, however, also required the appointment of a military chief for each province.
 Aware that the military might gain ascendancy and oppose civilian supremacy in the government during wartime, Aguinaldo specified that military chiefs were note empowered to interfere in the government and administration, and can only obtain reinforcements through the chiefs of the province/municipalities.

Conflict rose during the 1898 elections interpreting the June 18 decree, specifically, Article 9.
Article 9 stipulated that the government would name each province a commissioner vested with the power to establish revolutionary governments.
Moreover, military chiefs who wrested town from the Spaniards were election commissioners by virtue of their office. Military commanders rightly interpreted this as political reorganization could begin once towns were liberated from the Spaniards.
This process took place without difficulty.

Election proceedings were characterized by the cooperative supervision of the civil commissioner and the military commander.
Aguinaldo's instructions were sometimes disregarded, and only called upon when a military leader struggled for political ascendancy.

A general fear of overlapping responsibilities and preoccupation with specificity of duties characterized the relationship between the military commander and election commissioner in Laguna.

Differences in interpretation of the law did not escalate into a complete conflict that would prevent the establishment of provincial governments.
Election commissioner played a key role in political reorganization as they organized elections.

The commissioners, members of the political elite, recognized the existing power structure in the provinces at the demise of the colonial regime.
Most election commissioners were highly respected citizens.
Commissioners appointed deputy commissioners to expedite the elections as hundreds of towns had to be "reorganized." These deputies were equally respected and likely to be obeyed by the principales.

Aguinaldo's conservative policy of political reorganization was due to the elite's exclusive control over the electoral process.
Aguinaldo, a member of the municipal aristocracy, shared the same goal of the principalia, particularly that of the Tagalog region, specifically, the transfer of political power into their hands and elimination of priestly control.
Conservatism was a good political and military strategy, gaining the support of the Filipino elite.
Appointing ilustrados such as Pedro Paterno, Feipe Buencamino and Gregorio Araneta to his Cabinet would also bring expertise and prestige, Aguinaldo believed.

Aguinaldo advised insurgent leaders to leave local chiefs in their former officers to avoid widespread conflict.
Support of the municipal bureaucracy was considered necessary for the success of his government.
Equally necessary was maintaining men of power since Tagalog expeditionary troops sent to the non-Tagalog regions did not have a reservoir of ilustrados to take over civil administration.

Sometimes, non-ilustrados were elected into office, owing to the lack of qualifications of the old principalia.
The elite did not participate in these elections, such as Pangasinan elite who opposed the confirmation of popularly elected "uneducated" Filipinos and demanded a nullification of the elections.

In Solano, election of non-ilustrados caused unrest in the area with ilustrados protesting the "illegal" election.
Eventually Aguinaldo took the side of the principalia,  so that such elections were regularly voided.

# Survival of Local Elites
Spanish sympathizers were often elected into office as a result of the position being exclusively for the principalia.
The principalia's decision to embrace the revolutionary cause was a largely pragmatic decision.

Cagayanos appointed into office instead of Tagalogs gained the support of Tirona by putting on a patriotic act.
Tirona's request of Tagalog troops as they prepared for the American blockade of the Cagayan coast and for help collecting war taxes was ignored.

The elitist provisions of the June 18 decree and the strategic need to rely upon the municipal officials for the continuation of the Revolution led to the preservation of the elite.
No significant social change in political leadership in the provinces was discernible.

A comparison of
1. the list of municipal officials in the Guias Oficiales (1890-1898);
2. list of municipal president prepared by the Malolos Republic;
3. data from numerous actas de eleccions (1898-1899);
4. data on municipal officials and "prominent" families throughout Luzon from the Histrocial Data Papers;
5. the scattered "loyalty" reports prepared by the US Army
showed that the municipal elite was essentially unaltered, and that the local government rotated within its ranks.

Families who controlled local politics during the colonial regime dominated the Republican government.
These families also joined the Katipunan, often as leaders.

A common complaint among rival principales and the masses were the lack of revolutionary fervor, and perpetuation of corruption and abuse of power among elite families.
In the case of Kandaba, Pampanga, during the elections, the ballots of the common folk were disregarded.

The Evangelistas were sympathizers of the Spaniards; fed and supported teh Guardia Civil sent into town to suppress rebels; and collected the taxes from the townspeople into his private coffers.
Kandaba citizens requested a nullification of the elections, but a response was not heard.

There was little evidence of the Republic correcting the evil aspects of regnant familism.
Dealing with the Americans, and searching for support throughout Luzon, the government may not have any alternative.

The Revolution's survival was not under threat.
Aguinaldo needed the support of the elite, and the elite responded with its support.

# Civil-Military Conflicts
The function of the civil and military officials became intertwined.
The functions of the military sometimes overlapped with civil officials, and confusion arose from the assertions of military officials that they had the right to undertake the same responsibilities of civil officials. Jealous of their positions, civil officials protested this assertions to officials in the central government and Aguinaldo, and stressed a need for distinction between their powers.

Aguinaldo's injunction that military officials should act only with the consent of the civil officials was often breanched.
The Filipino-American war widened the gap between the military and civil officials.
On 4 February, Aguinaldo granted the military greater powers than civil officials throughout Luzon, in view of the ongoing war.
Naturally, the latter responded negatively, so Aguinaldo reiterated their position as prescribed by Article 9 of the June 18 decree.

Protests against the military was widespread, affected most of Luzon.
In Pangasinan, which was divided into two zones due to two rival groups of provincial officials, the military commander's intervention caused confusion in civil affairs regarding who to obey as the final authority.
The declaration of martial law in Ambos Camarines by the provincial military commander upon the outbreak of the war caused deep resentment from the civil authorities, who claimed it caused panic and anxiety among the people.
The declaration of martial law led to suspension of commerce and paralysis of agriculture.

Reports of many provincial and municipal bureaucrats revealed they considered the military a threat to their supremacy in politics, and a stumbling block to good government.
In Bataan, Zambales, Tayabas and Isabela, the provincial military commanders were reported to have "invaded" the office of provincial officials, leaving them virtually powerless with few tasks to undertake yet remaining fully responsible for military abuse.

In many towns, military authorities competed with local officials in the collection of taxes, conscription of personal labor (polo) and other traditional responsibilities of civilian authorities. However, it should be noted, that collection of the same tax by both civil and military collectors was not unusual.
The military even assumed routine duties, such as the dissemination of orders from Malolos, to the discomfort of municipal officials who consequently had reduced contact with the populace.

Several officials were troubled by the rising militarism.
The president of Bataan feared that military officials would organize a faction that could grow beyond his control.
Instead of providing surplus arms to municipal police forces when fighting tulisan bands, arms were awarded to favorites who menaced the peace of towns.
The president of Antipolo claimed that Morong (now Rizal) was plagued by the abuses of the insurgent militia under General Pio del Pilar. The soldiers pillaged the countryside and gambled, the latter being prohibited by Aguinaldo yet encouraged by del Pilar.
When Americans attacked Cainta, del Pilar's troops retreated in complete disarray, and the townspeople fought the Americans themselves after disarming the soldiers.

Manuel Arguelles, one of Aguinaldo's advisers, warned him that the rise of militarism was harmful to the health of the Republic.
Daniel Tirona, military commander of Cagayan Valley, disagreed, claiming the military was needed to check on a civil bureaucracy endowed with the "spirit of absolutism" inherited from Spain.
Tirona wrote to Aguinaldo that all of northern Luzon be placed under a single general to restore order and cease the factionalism between the military and civil officials.

The central government, troubled by the civil-military conflict, was unable to resolve it.
The Secretary of War issued a warning of the error to "substitute Spanish militarism with Filipino militarism". He reiterated that military officials did not have jurisdictional, disciplinary or even tax powers over the people.
The only duty of the military was to fight the "North American invaders".
He warned that any military officials who infringed on the prerogatives of civilian bureaucracy would be severely punished.
Mabini, who favored the institution of military dictatorship, was defeated by Congress who refused his proposal that the military commanders be made the sole authority in each province.
Mabini did not insist on his proposal any further as he was aware of the complaints against the military throughout Luzon, and felt too difficult to remove an abusive official from his command.
Solving the problem in favor of either group may have escalated the conflict.

# Alienation of the Masses
The civil-military conflict had a profoundly disturbing impact on the masses.
Moth civil and military authorities made demands for personal services, in violation of the Aguinaldo's decree that abolished the polo y servicios.
The extortionate levy of old and new taxes, embezzlement of public funds by government official angered the populace.
Mabini recognized "the peril we have at home, the ... abuses which may give rise to a new revolution."

In a letter to Aguinaldo, Cecilio Apostol write of the magnitude of administrative problems that the Republic had to resolve. Apostol saw only confusion and a scramble for power among the elite:
	"There exist here [in Pangasinan] two Departmental Provinces, one calling itself that of Northern Luzon and of which Don Vicente del Prado is the President, and the other which calls itself that of Northern and Central Luzon, presided over by Don Juliano Paraiso. Besides these two gentlemen, there are two governors in the province, one Civil Political Military, living in Lingayen, named Don Felipe Bartolome, and another living in Real Guerrero, a town of Tayug, named Don Vicente Estrella. And in addition, there are a large number of Administrators, Inspectors, Military Judges, Generals...and they cannot be counted. It is a pandemonium which even Christ, who permitted it, cannot make anything out of. Indeed the situation is indefensible. It reminds me of the schism in the middle ages when there were two Popes, both legitimate, neither true. Things as are clear as thick chocolate, as the Spaniards say.
	Article 9 [of the June 18 decree] says that the Superior Government will name a commissioner for each province with the special duty of establishing there the [political] organization set forth in the decree. Very well so far: which of the so-called Presidents of Norther or of Northern and Central Luzon is the commissioner appointed by that Government to establish the new organization in that Province? Are military commanders named by you for Pangasinan? I would be very much surprised if either of them could show their credentials.
	But poor, ignorant creatures, in so far as the republican form of government is concerned, order to avoid worse evils, took them at their word, obeyed them like automatons, hypnotized by the title of "Insurgents" which they applied to themselves. But when I had the opportunity to read the said decree, doubts were forced upon me, I began to suspect – may God and they pardon me – that they were trying to impose upon us, so slyly, an affair shielded by the motto "loyal service to the mother country" when in fact they came to these towns "for business""

Ten months later, an anonymous resident of Pangasinan sent a letter describing the same political scenario:
	"Since the decree of the national loan was issued, many of the residents have asked themselves in wonder, where have the sums collected gone to?... What are those sums? Where are those Mondragon guns that fire 60 shots a minute? Was there ever so great a fraud! If they do no properly account for how these sums have been employed the province will consider them [the provincial and municipal officials] thieves.
	[The military commanders], taking advantage of the present situation, force all males, without distinction of [social class], to drill with arms, and order them to do guard duty each day...
	The local chiefs of the province...are despotic kings in their respective pueblos, with the exception of one who is the local chief of Urbiztondo... What is the result of the abuses committed by the local chiefs? Disapprobation, ill humour and a great deal of regret for having worked for independence because there were certain orders and customs which it intended to abolish, and instead, they continue practising them, and that which previously was to be despised in the Spaniards, is respected now among the local chiefs. Furthermore, as the people know that the provincial chief takes no notice of the complaints against the local chiefs, the residents thereof endure, suffer and say, "A thousand times better the Spanish government than this".
	There are persons who have said: "I was very glad and content when the separation from the Spanish Dominion was obtained, but now we have to swallow very bitter pills which the Spaniards never forced us to take.""

Deliberations over the constitution in Malolos and contending with the Americans seemed more important than other problems.
Aguinaldo lacked the means to impose centralized control and powerless to curb the abuses of government officials in towns distant from the political center.
It was difficult to discipline official abuse in the provinces when the central government depended on the men responsible for it.
An unidentified commented "The governor-general is in Manila (far away); the king is in Spain (farther still); and God is in heaven (farthest of all)."

Aguinaldo was frustrated at his inability to curb widespread misgovernment, and offered to resign the presidency eight months after he assumed leadership.
His resignation letter was suppressed by his Cabinet, particularly Mabini and Buencamino.

The Secretary of the Interior instructed provincial officials and investigators to make inspection trips with the purpose of reporting cases of misgovernment and recommending the proper course of reform. However, few of these trips were made.
The punishment for abuse of power, even in the most serious of cases, were simply removal from office.

The ground rules established by Aguinaldo for political reorganization carefully preserved the colonial elite.
Those few elected non-elite entered into office by the citizenry, not by principalia, on the basis of their active support of the Revolution.
Only the Spanish colonial master was gone; on the provincial and municipal levels, the same actors performed the same unchanging rules.
The firm entrenchment of municipal officials who openly sympathized with the Spaniards, and use of unconstrained authority by many local officials, led to widespread frustration.
The perpetuation of the same aspects of colonial rule that weakened the reformist and integrative goals of the Revolution, alienated many citizens from the Republic and contributed to the peasant resistance against attempts of the political elite to thwart their expectation of the rewards of the Revolution.
As quick as the elite claimed leadership of the Revolution, the masses demanded they also enjoy the rewards of the Revolution through good government and abolition of taxes and forced labor.
When these demands were not accepted, meany peasants joined tax riots, demonstrations, and messianic movements.
If the Filipino elite were the ultimate victors of the Revolution, then the masses in the provinces were the unwitting victims.
