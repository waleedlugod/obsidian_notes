# The Fantasy of the Japanese Empire and Its Mobilization through Cinema
Through the 1930s and 1940s, cinema discussed the formation of the Japanese empire.
It began with Japan's acquisition of Taiwan from the Qing Dynasty after the Sino-Japanese War in 1895.
The empire later then acquired Southern Sakhalin from Russia in 1905, the Kwantang Territory from Qing, the annexation of Korea in 1910, and the assumption of the mandated administration of the South Sea Islands from the League of Nations.
They expansion acceleration with the Manchurian Incident in 1931, the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, and its invasions of Malaya and the Philippines.
Cinema was a means to form entities in different territories: the national populace in Japan proper and Manchukuo; the national populace and the imperial subject in Korea and Taiwan; and the East Asian race in the territories called the "Greater East Asia Co-Properity Sphere".
Cinema was a means for the entire Japanese empire to become subjects of the emperor-centered state voluntarily and spontaneously.

Cinema was used to mobilize the population towards war.
Bureaucrats and film practitioners negotiated in regulating the industry.
Bureaucrats and entrepreneurs of the time based their political and commercial assessments on attendance figures.
If a film was well attended, then regulations were effective, and were a failure otherwise.
However, it is a mistake to assume large attendance implied it contributed to the mobilization regime as the audience may be critical of the ideology the film intends to propagate.

With the discourse of the audiences, fantasies of community were created, which the discourse attempted to realize.
These discourse involved creating a normative view of the audiences.
When the audiences did not fit their constructions, they disavowed such a reality despite its concrete existence.

The subjects of the empire was idealized and made normative with terms such as "the East Asian race".
Cinema was an opportunity to form subjects of "the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" which would be regarded as an East Asian community with Japan at the center.
This image was contradictory and inconsistent.
Its contradictions were rooted in culturalism and modernism, identity and discrimination, political rights and culture, and intellect and affect.
Discourses did not question these inconsistencies but made them ambiguous or tried to render them consistent.
The nostalgia of the Japanese empire's expansion is rooted in the idealization of "the East Asian race".

Cinema attendance was a means to configure inhabitants of the empire into "the East Asian race".
This mobilization system had crucial ties to capitalism.
A large number of people were perceived to attend movie theaters in Tokyo, Osaka, Keijo (Seoul), Taipei, Shanghai, Xingjing (Changchun), Fengtian (Shenyang), and other cities.
Cinema-goers were equated with "the masses" that emerged from capitalism and consumer culture.
Film writers aimed to cultivate "the masses" into Japan's "national populace".
They also proposed incorporating the "new audiences", those outside the framework of capitalism and not within "the masses" such as provincial residents and minorities.
In parallel with the discussions of "the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity", bureaucrats and critics criticized capitalism and modernism on the grounds they originated from the West, yet at the same time utilizing them for their own purposes.
The mobilization system of "the East Asian race" was not recognized as the fantasy it was.
"The East Asian race" was affected by issues identity to those of "the national populace".

# The Empire and "the East Asian Race"
"The East Asian race" functioned as a contradictory fiction, which was unacknowledged as such, and justified the empire.

The Japanese empire was being described as "Eight Corners of the World under One Roof" and "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere".
The source of the former was the ancient, canonized book The Chronicles of Japan, which became a guiding principle after the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 when the Movement for the General Mobilization of the National Spirit was launched.
The book justified the national political organization at the time.
"Eight Corners of the World under One Roof" sat alongside notions like "Five-Race Harmony" and "Royal-road-ism" which ran counter to Western military-based governance.
In November 1938, the first Konoe Fumimaro Cabinet issued a construction statement for a "New Order in East Asia"; In September 1939, World War II broke out in Europe; in May and June 1940, Holland then France surrendered to Germany—these events drove the expansion of the empire.
In July 1940, the second Konoe cabinet approved the "basic outline of national policy," reformulating the expression "Eight Corners of the World under One Roof" as the "New Order of East Asia."
Soon followed was the establishment of "the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere" that aimed to acquire British, French, and Dutch colonies in East and Southeast Asia.
The terms kōkoku shinmin and kōmin, both translated as "the imperial subjects," were adopted in Korea and Taiwan.
These terms overlapped with both "the national populace" and "the East Asian race" and began to appear in discourses including those on cinema audiences across colonized areas.

The term "the national populace" refers to "the Japanese" encompassing the bloodline of Japan proper with multiple ethnic identities living in Manchukuo.
In the colonized areas of Korea and Taiwan, the term designated their own inhabitants and those of the Japanese empire as a whole, and was almost synonymous with "the imperial subjects."
The term "the East Asian Race" encompassed notion of "the national populace" and "the imperial subjects", and the use of them in discourse revealed numerous inconsistencies.
Their use also alluded to the history of the empire, specifically under the colonial policy of "inland territorial expansionism" which considered areas adjacent to Japan proper as part of Japan.
Although Manchukuo was a puppet of the empire, it was proclaimed an independent nation-state, whose control was justified in striving for "the integration of the nation through a symbol" and "the systematization of society."
This was influenced by nationalism propagated through the principle national self-determination which became a global trend after World War I and was anti-imperialist in nature.

The terms "the imperial subjects," "the national populace," and "the East Asian race" were also contradictory and cloaked discrimination.
Those who lived in colonized areas, despite sharing the colonizers' nationality, were distinguished on family registers.
Women throughout the empire and people outside Japan proper could not participate in elections to the Imperial Diet. Korean and Taiwanese men gained suffrage in April 1945 as a means to conceal political and economical inequalities.

Ambiguous combination of discrimination and identity was a characteristic tendency of academic discourse on "race".
"Race" and "ethnicity" are not binary opposites, but developed somewhat distinguished yet intricately intertwined.
Race is often translated as jinshu while ethnicity as minzoku.
Japanese discourse on ethnicity developed in three directions: native ethnology of the Yamato minzoku or folklore; Tōyō minzokugaka or Oriental ethnology; and the later notion of minzoku as nationality rights.
1920s onwards, minzoku tended to replace jinshu.
These notions of minzoku was significant for the mobilization of Japanese nationalism.
Discourses on minozoku often contradicted as they were based on ideas such as "the racially exclusive Yamato minzoku," "the idea of a Japanese minozoku based on a racial, but assimilative, thesis of mixed nations," and "the idea of an alliance of different nationalities under a common state developed in Manchukuo."
These ideas adjusted themselves for the benefit of the expanding empire, and to justify racist views.
Minzoku served as a rationale for discourses on "the East Asian race" which emphasized its identity and commonality while presupposing that there is an absolute difference between "the Japanese" and the rest of the Asian people.
It also distinguished East Asia's commonality from the West despite having clear influences from social Darwinism.
The authority academics possessed in such discourse helped circulated these ideas as truth rather than fiction.

Asianism was linked to such discourse.
Following the Sino-Japanese War of 1937, two theories about Japan's relationship with Asia were proposed: an East Asian League, and an East Asia Community with the former being more totalitarian that sought liberation from Western imperialism and promoted regional integration, while the latter aimed for the formation of a socialist East Asia, criticized Japanese imperialism, and supported the revision of capitalism.
These ideas reached intellectuals in China and Korea, providing an opportunity to break through inequalities they suffered.
Both ideas served as a means to justify Japanese imperialism as audiences seemed to not understand the theories as distinct.
Advocates of the "East Asian Community" fell during the oppression by the Konoe-led New Regime Movement.

The expansion of the empire involved "six sites": the mass media, Japan's polity, the expanding alliance between public and private interests, utopian dreams or idealistic visions of economic development, state intervention in the economy and society, and political institutions defining "the topography of a total empire."
The empire could not halt its expansion as responsibility was dispersed among multiple institutions, their multilayered decision-making functions, and the social functions of such institutions which permeated people's everyday experience.
Cinema, having remarkable social influence, and closely related to all six sites, was incorporated into the imperial regime.

# The Empire and Film Policy
In February 1933, "Proposals for a National Film Policy" were submitted, signalling Japan regarding film as a national policy, though scope limited to Japan proper.
Several regulations made "excellent films" exempt from censorship fees.
Based on the Film Law, the culture of Japan proper and people were designated Japanese nationality.
The two types of "national film" established by the Information Bureau were required to be "entertainment for the national populace as a whole," but this "national populace" were not supposed to include people from outside Japan proper.
Japanese censorship aimed to manage film distribution in Japan proper rather than their production directly.
Japanese film policy makers distinguished Japan proper from the rest of the empire.
Fuwa Suketoshi, director of the Second Section of the Fifth Division of the Information Bureau, aimed to enlighten the national populace and, outside, establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Regions outside Japan proper had their own institutional systems, though still followed the policies of Japan proper.
Korea established their own film censorship regulations that mirrored the Film Law of Japan proper.
Taiwan also established their own regulations, but was vastly different to the Film Law.
Regulations were also established for the Southern Region which includes the Philippines.
There was a clear demarcation between Japan proper and the rest of the Japanese empire in terms of both legal and corporate management.

There was a clear imbalance of people going from Japan proper to the rest of the empire, and those going the opposite direction.
Many film practitioners from Japan proper remained in occupied areas for a period of time.
Attempts were actively made to distribute films from Japan proper to the occupied areas, but far fewer cases of the reverse. Those that did enter Japan proper were rarely popular, and sometimes discriminated against.
This phenomenon was analogous to other inequalities suffered by those on occupied areas.

Legal systems and those of film-making operated on an area-by-area basis.
Film policies of Taiwan and Korea were rarely acknowledged as using cinema as a means of propaganda because they were assumed to be regions within Japan already.
From the Japanese perspective, the culture of the Southern Region were lower than that of the Chinese.
Japanese films were not well received in the Philippines as the Japanese army invaded the Islands, facilitated by a tolerant US colonial policy.

"The East Asian race" aimed to unite the empire's inhabitants, but was ridden with discriminatory structures.

# Fantasy of Sameness
Audience discourses were authored by a variety of writers including film-makers, entrepreneurs, bureaucrats, critics, journalists, and general readers, and published in numerous types of media.
Their format varied between critical essays, roundtable discussions, columns, and readers' contributions.
These papers were mostly written in Japanese, but were occasionally in local languages.
Strict censorship prohibited any expression of resistance against the empire.
Articles written by people in occupied areas were often from the perspective of those in power.
Discussions to attract people to create "the East Asian race" as subjects of "the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" rested on three main premises: a commonality between "the East Asian race" and their shared identity; Japan's central, privileged position within it; and its appeal to all levels of their bodies from their spirit to their physical senses.
The commonality of "the East Asian race" was contradictory as it was seemed to be a necessary vision, yet was talked of as if it were already existing and unchanging.

Despite the contradictory nature of discourses on"the East Asian race," they are still underpinned by common concepts such as territory.
Some discourses presupposed that such as territory corresponded to East and Southeast Asia, which had been invaded by the Japanese.
Another aspect of the assumed notion of commonality was culture. According to Ichikawa Sai, "the East Asian race" shares a "fundamental Oriental sense."
He also proposed an alternative framework for "the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" as an integrated entity independent  of established geographical and cultural reference points.

These three constituents of commonality were largely contradictory.
Commonality was defined in relations to the differences between East Asia and the West other than on more substantial grounds.
The Southern Region tended to be seen as an exotic object, unlike Chinese mainland which was considered an extension of Japan, similar to how the West viewed East Asia.
Categories like "Europe and America" and "white" were complicated by the fact that Germany and Italy were allies.
Discourses within the empire emphasized commonalities between Japan and East Asia (Korea, China, Manchuria, and Taiwan), but regarded Japan as "liberators" to the Southern Region.
Moreover, in discussions about audiences, minzoku (race) tended to imply commonality based on physical traits despite Asia's inhabitants possessing a diversity of traits.
In emphasizing commonality, diversity was obscured.

# Hidden Centrality
Japan was assumed to hold a central position in "the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity," despite also assuming sameness between "the East Asian race."
Japan tended to use euphemisms such as "possession" instead of "colonialism".
Writers also did not touch upon Japanese colonialism and used terms such as "leader".
Such discussions also presupposed the centrality of Japan, symbolized by the emperor.

Several conceptual tendencies appeared in discourse on "the East Asian race" that was premised on Japanese centrality: culturalism, modernism, paternalism, and the ideology of cross-cultural understanding.
Despite the contradictions of these ideas, they were rarely questioned.

Modernism refers to a preference for modernization, clearly inconsistent with culturalism which valued traditional Japanese culture that was assumed to not have been changed since ancient times.
Hasegawa Nyozekan, a critic, stated Japanese civilization has a sustained character that has lasted for several thousand years, but through the lens of modernism, the culture has progress from immature to an advanced state.
Critic Tsumura Hideo utilized notions of modernism and culturalism opportunistically. He critized America for their superficial materialist culture, yet remarked to need to introduce a simpler material civilization to the "savage natives of the south."
In discourse on the "East Asian race" the modernist opinion predominated that Japan should present a modern, material, economic, technological, and military appearance, underpinned by a notion of rivalry between the West.
Such remarks showed a modernist tendency to situate races within a hierarchy, and a hierarchical relationship between the center and the periphery.

Modernist views were closely linked to paternalism, particularly in relation to race and culture.
Japan was positioned as the leader of "the East Asian race."
Such notions were validated by views as cultures outside Japan as low, tasking Japan to educate and liberate "the East Asian race" and develop "awareness of being imperial subject."

Discourse of this kind obscured the contradictions in the empire's rule.
It did not criticize the violence of the Japanese army, or the fact that Japan did not have sufficient economic power to replace the trading system of the "Intra-Southeast Asian Trade Area" that had been established by the West.
Paternalistic discourse on "the East Asian race" supported discriminatory structures as the most obedient to Japanese leadership should be placed at the top of the hierarchy, causing competition between the governed.

In addition to culturalism, modernism, and paternalist, and ideology of cross-cultural understanding supported the centrality of Japan.
This represented an idea to understand the other's culture, but maintaining exclusivity between them.
Roundtable participants recognized the necessity of mutual understanding, yet held an apprehension of the other based on their differences, with the other being a subordinate.

Accepting this hidden Japanese centrality as a given was closely related to the ideological and structural imbalances of the empire.
The shift from a concept of the empire as "Eight Corners of the World under One Roof" to "The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" would entail its expansion, justified by Japan's centrality, despite being never spoken about.
Japanese critics and bureaucrats anticipated that territory outside Japan proper would be portrayed as an exotic object, or as a backdrop to the Japanese military's successful activities, or something that would satisfy the soldiers' families' concerns.
The Film Law rendered it impossible to showcase the violence of the Japanese army.

# Appealing to Physical Senses, or "Spirit" and Science
The ideology of the empire was also conveyed through all levels of their bodies from their spirit to their physical senses.
Discourse made no distinction betwene the moment of the audience's reception of a film and afterwards, some naively assuming inhabitants would be transformed into "the East Asian race" upon watching a film that appealed to their senses.
Tsumura, author of Film War remarked the numerous illiterate people among the "Greater East Asian races" and "the masses' most susceptible weakness is their sensibilities."
Intellectuals who sympathized with such ideas thought of using films for mobilization.

The government public policy prioritized the state's interest over the profit of companies contributed to the forming and mobilizing "the East Asian race" and of establishing a cinema-based mobilization system underpinned by a capitalist system that could not be rejected.
Such discourse were varied but all attempted to relate capitalist principles to their conceptions of the mobilization system, and were based two main ideas: using existing capitalist mechanisms, and those outside capitalism, such as minorities and those living without movie theaters.
Public policy sought to promote the systematization of mobilization through cinema that complemented capitalism, contradicting the empire's denial of materialism.
Mobilization was also divided into three stages: of people to cinema audiences, of audiences to "the East Asian race", and of people into soldiers or laborers.
These stages were not consistent, and distinctions were often blurred.

Due to the recognition of cinema's social impact, demand to incorporate cinema into the mobilization system was growing.
Cinema was regarded as part of culture according to the theory of "publicity" and was born out of technology that appeared in the modern age along with newspaper and radio, making it the focus of attention.
The specific nature of cinema was encapsulated in three characteristics: its visuality and comprehensibility; its mechanical reproducibility and collective reception; and its popularity.

According to film critic Imamura Taihei, film allowed and equalization of culture and knowledge of the literate and illiterate, unlike literature which can be understood only by the educated.

Imamura stressed two dimension of the comprehensibility of film: democratic fascism, entailing support of fascism not out by oppression but on equal footing; and its visuality functioning, foremost, affectively.
Fascism was treated aesthetically.
Imamura described the role of "cultural film" for "the popularization of science," describing it as "a technique other than logical justification."
Imamura understood film as a sensory affective tool rather than an intellectual one.
Presupposing that the rest of the empire were uneducated, he felt they should receive the educational and inspirational benefits of film.

Discourse on audiences observed that visuality alone did not enable the rest of the empire to understand it.
Tsumura recommended to not rely on visuals alone, but to include voiceover narration or using a benshi.
The practice of having benshi contradicted government policy to eradicate local languages in favor of promoting the use of Japanese.
Benshi could be used as a medium for resistance to the Japanese insofar as the voice performer's improvised narration could skew the meaning of a film.

Imamura also argued the idea that viewing a film was a "collective" experience made possible by mechanical reproduction technology.
Film was collective partly because it had the capacity to allow numerous people to share emotions and ideas, and party because, unlike the non-simultaneous reading of literature, watching a film was simultaneous.
Although this view initially proceeded from his Marxist standpoint, it became a justification for the mobilization system of the empire.

By the 1930s, a focus on measuring audiences became widely shared among bureaucrats, critics, and journalists.
Film critics paid attention to box-office performances not just of individual films but of the entire range of genre.
There was a reciprocity between films' overall popularity and a quantitative view of audiences.
Various discourses described audiences as a quantity rather than individual via the term "the masses."

# The Empire and Capitalism
The government sought to capitalize on the influence of cinema to support the mobilization system, regardless of their naivety of their assumption that watching films would directly mobilize their formation of "the national populace" or "the East Asian race."
Despite the government's embrace of cinema, discourse on "the East Asian race" promoted capitalism while simultaneously appearing to disavow it.
Discourse contrasted cinema as a "cultural property" and as "national culture" and cinema as a "commodity" for "the masses."
Fuwa Suketoshi of the Ministry of Education warns against cinema as a commodity, yet writes with praise about films with "the greatest mass appeal."
The marketability of films were valued while the pursuit of private interests were opposed.

The relationship between public policy on cinema and capitalism was mirrored in the relationship between government regulation and the film industry.
The use of cinema, a product of capitalism, began to be included in public policy when the Education Ministry incorporated it into social education in the 1920s.
The Education Ministry moved to make cinema a tool for social education by introducing a film recommendation system (which aimed to select film for their educational purpose), organizing lectures for benshi (which intended to educate benshi to serve the state), and mounted the Motion Picture Exhibition (which attempted to publicize film as a useful educational medium).
Government regulation pervaded the film industry from production to distribution and exhibition.
Film companies were never nationalized, and movie theaters were financed by admission rather than government funding.

The film distribution network of "the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" was based on an ambiguous relationship between the films' political objectives and their commercial marketability.
The Greater East Asia Film Council aimed to integrate film companies in order to coordinate the mobilization system in a more rational way.
Such integration was linked to the attempts of Japan-centered companies to drive out US films to secure profits.
President of the China Film Union Company, Kawakita Nagamasa, declared it would stop producing film critical of Japan's maneuvering against China, and would target "the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" signalling their priority of securing a market than of edification.
The film distribution network was flawed given the imbalance of films made in Japan proper that were distributed outside, and the far fewer films made in occupied areas sent inside.
Film that were did make it inside Japan proper were rarely popular.
Screening films of occupied areas risked losing Japanese audiences, and the Korean Film Production Company did not stop Japanese films dominating the domestic market.
The empire's cinema-based mobilization maintained a relationship with market principles.

The unstable relationship between the logics of the empire and capitalism was seen in how film genres were configured.
The Film Law stipulated the obligatory screening of documentary films and their categorization as "culture films," intending to such films regardless of their marketability.
Because film exhibition were largely in commercial hands, people had no obligation to attend movie theaters in the first place.
The price of admission included the "culture film."
A phenomenon was observed where the "culture film" roused more curiosity than of the fiction film itself.
Film of public and market origins were combined a complementary way.
It was assumed that "the masses" in cities attended move theaters out of their own free will, and would spontaneously become subjects of the empire through non-compulsory film-viewing.

The relationship between the logic of the empire and capitalism were also shaped by two aims: enlightening the public, and attracting them to movie theaters in high numbers.
The larger objectives, to cultivate "the masses" into "the national populace" and "the East Asian race", and to attract "the masses" into the movie theater, could be achieved regardless for whether the aims were consistent.
Japan's desire for recognition for its centrality revealed itself in the demands audience discourses made of filmmakers.
These demands originated in five conflictual tendencies: universalism, culturalism, modernization, the tenant that films were entertainment, and indigenization.

Imamura believed art to be a universalist, transcendental principle.
He believed, films of high art merit should have been able to attract people of any cultural background to the movie theater and enlighten them.
Imamaura aimed to accommodate both the logic of the market, to promote film consumption by virtue of the cinema's appeal, and the logic of the empire, to enlighten people in occupied territories.
However, Imamura's idea of "art" was idiosyncratic given his liking towards nazi films, and none of the "national films" selected for the Information Bureau Award in 1941 and 1942 accomplished the feat of being both commercially successful and enlightening audiences.
An article in the film magazine Kinema junpō suggested that although "national films" were artistically excellent, it was common sense to anticipate their failure in occupied areas.

Such notions of universalism were in tension with culturalism, which emphasized Japanese culture as traditional and distinctive.
Critics such as Hasegawa Nyozekan advocated for Japanese self-sufficiency; for preserving its uniqueness and preventing the influence of foreign culture.
When questioned how Japanese films would penetrate "the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," conflicts between an idealistic notion—that Japanese culture should be universally accepted—and a more realistic one—that it should be accepted on its own terms—surfaced.
Overall, critics, bureaucrats, and industry personnel abandoned idealism and became more realistic.
Discourse suggested that Japanese films were perceived as limited in their capacity to convey a sense of Japan proper's privileged status over the occupied areas.
There was also anxiety for a possible reversal of this hierarchy.

Modernism tended to be prioritized over culturalism.
Pieces published in the film magazine Eiga junpō frequently argued that films should demonstrate Japanese economic power, and make spectacles of technologies.
Many argued that "the dignity of Japan" should be portrayed through "militarily powerful films."
In discourses, a logic operated that modernization was a vehicle of the superior-inferior relationship between the ruler and the ruled.
The superiority of Japan was expressed in terms of its evolution by means of spectacular modern icons, and its centrality expressed in terms of the dimensions of the empire.
Discussions that mentioned "Japanese customs" often meant a modernized way of life rather than "traditional culture."
In Manchukuo, there was a prevailing notion that the advancement of national integration should be based on highly capitalistic culture than of Japanese culture.
However, universalist ideas of "high" art and culturalist notions of Japan were mere idealism and made little impression on wider society.
Modernist ideas were perceived as somewhat effective, and provided a point of intersection between the logic of the empire and capitalism that underpinned modernization.

Logics of the empire and capitalism were not always symbiotic.
These ideas clashed in the discourse that cinema must entertain above all else.
Film's obligation to entertain does not necessarily accommodate Japan's mission to mobilize an "East Asian race" centered on Japan.
Discourses in Manchukuo put aside cinema's purpose as propaganda while arguing cinema's marketability was its primary objective.

From the 1920s onward, discourse on "popular entertainment" advocated leading people by means of entertainment, to support the political regime voluntarily without making them feel coerced.
Discussion also went as far as to ignore cinema's efficacy as propaganda altogether and focused exclusively on what kinds of film should be made to attract people.
The notion of film as entertainment constrained the logic of the empire.
Although some films may be highly popular films, critics deem some to be unsuitable to distribute within "the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere" as they created ambivalence.
However, comedies which contained "little trace of national policy propaganda" were screened to alleviate uneasiness about Japanese dominance.
Yet, such screenings provoked an anxiety in the Japanese that they were despised by occupied areas.
The logic of the empire and capitalism often clashed.
However, discourses did not refute capitalism completely nor acknowledge the contradictory notions, but rather sought to accommodate both.

Some recommended that films be indigenized to attract audiences.
Benshi provided a means to attract local audiences.
Benshi had the potential to weave anti-imperial insinuations into performances.
The empire's discourse considered benshi to be an effective means to make Japanese films acceptable to local populations, however, much of this discourse assumed the logic of the empire and capitalism were consistent.
While the problem of making films acceptable to indigenous audiences were a primary cause for concern, how films might contribute to the mobilization system was regarded as self-evident and not discussed.
In movie theaters in Korea, radio announcements from the government office were broadcast during intervals between screenings, and exhibitors were obliged to interrupt screenings to allow patrons to pray silently to the emperor each day at noon.

Various operations of cinema ran according to capitalist principles, from production and representation to distribution and exhibition.
The system of mobilization through cinema followed suit, despite standing somewhat in opposition to capitalist principles.
People also voluntarily paid to watch films.
Capitalist principles underpinned their mobilization into "the East Asian race" and into participating in a war to support the empire.

# Beyond Capitalism
The government did not envision capitalism placing constraints on public policy, but rather, policy sought to extend the mobilization system beyond the capitalist hubs to the outskirts of cities.
Such policy mainly addressed ethnic minorities and those living in provincial areas where private companies did not find it easy to pursue profit, or there were no movie theaters.
It also targeted cities who could not afford to go or were not in the habit of going to the movie theater.
Public policy intended to expand the mobilization system by operating in areas capitalism could not reach.
Policy aimed to eliminate inequalities between Japan proper and occupied areas, contradictory to the notion of the centrality of Japan.

It was necessary to overcome educational disparities to expand accessibility to movie theaters.
Two issues regarding this were notable: cinema has the potential to be understood regardless of level of literacy, and the use of benshi rendered educational levels less critical to the audience comprehension; and high levels of education, greater take-up of capitalism, and modernization seem to correlation with frequent attendance.
Critics considered colonized areas to be behind in Japan proper's modernization and education, holding this responsible for the relative paucity of attendance.
Some critics argued that effort should be made to steer students and members of various groups towards movie theaters, or towards holding their screenings, through putting on screenings, rather than rely on people's voluntary consumption.

Eliminating disparities around access to movie theaters depended on addressing inequalities between urban and provincial areas, which can be summed up as differences in education.
It was a commonly held view in Japan proper that disparities should be improved through the wider dissemination of film via traveling screenings.
Several film companies conducted traveling screenings, but in Korea and Taiwan, this was provided by non-profit governmental and intermediate organizations.
It was envisioned that cinema would create an environment to encourage Korean people to become "imperial subjects" that same way schools, religion, language, broadcasting, publications, theaters, music, art, dance, and physical education did.
Film was envisioned to be integrated into people's everyday lives, overcoming differences in education, class, or origin so anyone can join "the East Asian race."

Making this vision of traveling screens a reality was difficult.
A spokesperson for the North China Film Company reported in 1941 that the company only runs three circuits because each costs about 30,000 yen to operate.
Traveling to Manchukuo was reported as extremely difficult as roads were poor.
In the Southern Region, issues arose regarding transporting materials, diverse background of audiences, and a territory too vast to cover.
The idea of forming a mobilization system through cinema was fundamentally contradictory as the formation of "the East Asian race" was not underpinned by an assumption of eventual equality.
Even though cinema tried to improve disparities, it did not shift them.
Homi Bhabha's concept of mimicry suggested that when the occupied mimicked the occupiers, a sense was produced that power imbalances were simply redressed, which might pose a threat to the occupier.
Discourse on audiences did not entertain the possibility of granting all parties equal political rights for the sake of mobilization.

Within the Japanese empire, discourse on audiences promoted a system of mobilization that would serve the total war regime.
It included critical remarks on "liberalism" and "materialism" despite the fact that this system was built in capitalism, evident in all aspects o contemporary film, from its industrial sectors and institutional practices (production, distribution, exhibition, and promotion), to its representational practices, to its forms o exhibition, and in the nature of cinema itself.
Public policy served to strengthen this capitalistic system advocating, and executing, screenings for groups and traveling screenings, which aimed to eliminate disparities in education between urban and provincial areas.
Surrounding audience discourse often accommodated opposing ideas, but nonetheless took the centrality of Japan for granted.

# The Post-Empire: Oblivion and Fantasy
Cinema audiences were held as a significant conduit for the formation of "the East Asian race."
This is a fantasy woven from idealizing and contradictory tendencies, and the disavowal of such contradictions.
"The East Asian race" was envisioned to be transcending geographical, racial, cultural, and historical differences within the empire while acknowledging disparities in education and class between Japan proper and the rest o the empire, and distinctions between occupied areas.
Such inconsistencies were overlooked along with gender imbalances.
"The East Asian race" was required to drive its own formation, however, how the fantasy would translate into institutional practices remained not discussed.
Discourse that proposed mobilizing cinema audiences proposed a structure to realize the fantasy, yet, simultaneously disavowed a lack of integration caused by the way practices and languages varied.

By the wake of their defeat in WWII, the policy of mobilizing "the East Asian race" was abandoned.
The territory of Japan was reduced to the Japanese archipelago, and indirectly ruled by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers/General Headquarters.
After April 28, 1952, when the occupation by SCAP/GHQ ended, the San Francisco Treaty (between Japan and the Allied Powers) designated Japan's territory with some exceptions, later returned (Ogasawara Islands by 1968, and Okinawa by 1972).
The treaty was somewhat vaguely defined, leading to territorial disputes.
The previously occupied areas became areas of the countries to which they were returned.

Because the demarcation between "internal" and "external" to "the national populace" was both ambiguous and strict, those from the colonies were included and marginalized.
Under the jus sanguinis-based family register system, all colonized areas were strictly distinguished from those from Japan proper.
However, colonized Taiwan, Sakhalin (Karafuto), and Korea were "granted Japanese nationality."
The framework of "the national populace" was itself ambiguous in discourse.
Self-defined members of "the national populace" from the colonies clearly suffered discrimination regarding suffrage, family registration, and military service, and related legal provisions.
Efforts among colonized peoples to compete to be recognized as belonging to the "national populace" enhanced the imagined concept as a whole.
While notions of its homogeneity and egalitarian nature were idealized as a norm, its negative aspects were not questioned.

This structure, and its conflicts, continued in various forms since the end of the war.
Men from former colonies lost their voting rights in December 1945, and, regardless of gender, no longer allowed to avail themselves of Japanese citizenship, and subject to the restrictions imposed by jus sanguinis.
In other words, people from the former colonies were excluded from the constitutional framework as "foreigners" and deprived of their right to belong to the "Japanese national populace."
For Koreans living in Japan, the Japanese Nationality Law, based on jus sanguinis, does not allow dual nationality, so they must choose one and relinquish the other.
Such a strict setting of the legal boundary of "the national populace" caused Korean residents turmoil.
Residents of several generations had increasingly mixed identities and have often been called "post-zainichi."

In terms of modern history, scholars argued that the past of the empire has been obliterated in postwar Japan.
While various events were held to maintain the memory of WWII, few events were held to preserve memories of the empire.
In cultural discourse, the prevailing tendency has been to represent Japan as victims of war.
Erasure of the empire from Japan's public memory was encouraged by the fact that the Constitution of Japan was celebrated for pacifism and democracy, while high economic growth ensured the spread of consumer culture.
Reports of former soldiers and residents returning to Japan from colonies, and war-displaced orphans tended to be stereotyped as objects of pity.

In the 1980s, people moved to reflect upon the past.
Primer Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro visited the Yasukuni Shrine in 1985, democratization movements began in Korea and Taiwan, Cold War structures started to collapse in 1989, and voices from former colonies called public attention to comfort women, the Nanjing Incident, visits to Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese officials, and territorial disputes.
Scholarship on Japanese imperialism thrived.
Revisionist arguments about Japanese history regarded Japan as a victim.
While liberal critical discourse contrasted "postwar" pacifism to "prewar and wartime" violence, conservative organizations such as the Japan Conference emphasize pacifism as an attribute of the emperor-state while ignoring the violence perpetrated.

Hypothesis: the empires violent and aggressive nature has never been fully recognized because it was not publicly perceived even before the end of WWII.
The disavowal of such issues created the impression that all areas equally and spontaneously participated in upholding the empire, rather than forcibly.
Three conditions of "postwar" Japan served the foundation of the fantasy of the empire and its continuation: the question left by the re-imagined national framework regarding the geopolitics of East Asia after WWII; the patronage of the US to form "postwar" Japan; and Japan's rapid economic growth.
The "postwar" Japan of a peaceful, affluent country created with the support of the US, is contrasted with the "postwar" of other Asian countries.
Korean and Vietnam wars were regarded as "external" events by most Japanese, despite the economic benefits they brought.
The Japanese empire has also been remembered differently across the range of its constituents, including across gender, class, ethnic, and generational boundaries.
People who shared circumstances across regional boundaries can have similar memories, both intricate and shared.
In Japan, it was taken for granted that memories are determined by territory.

After conceding defeat in WWII, Japan's own territories was determined as part of both the Postdam Declaration and the San Francisco Treaty, and colonized areas were relinquished at the orders of the US, rather than the request of their inhabitants.
Regions part of the empire were reorganized according to an East-West framework determined by the Cold War's restructuring of geopolitical relations.
Only a few became nation-states, including the Philippines, which all saw a rise of militaristic nationalism.
Cinema continued to serve their respective populations during the occupation period.
Japan was able to enjoy peace and economic growth without much protest from the former colonies until the collapse of the Cold War regime in 1989.

Supported by the US, Japan achieved rapid economic growth.
This made it easy of the Japanese to adopt a self-centered perspective on equal footing with the West, while their Asian neighbors were comparatively behind.
Japan's predominance became a logical source of economic guidance or intervention from other countries.
The legacy of "the East Asian race" and its tendency to take Japanese centrality for granted transposed to the business arena.
Nonetheless, the Japanese tended to establish friendly relations with their Asian neighbors.

No policy of mobilizing Asian peoples for one purpose has since been formulated.
Cinema audiences has ceased to be regarded as a means to conceive such goals.
With the acceleration of globalization, it was difficult for Japan to enjoy its privileged economic status, and friction sparked over past events, territorial disputes, and labor issues.
Academic reappraisals of Japanese history of the empire helped resurrection iteration of its fantasy during the prewar and wartime periods, which was based on a dichotomous, pro vs anti-Japanese view.
