Japan: one of the few Asian states that successfully resisted Western imperialism
Philippines: first colony in East and Southeast Asia to successfully revolt against a colonial power

Japanese would later experience imperialism themselves through Commodore Matthew Perry who would forcefully open Japan to international trade. Japan had only previously traded with Dutch merchants.
Eventually led to Boshin war and Shogunrule

Eras: Meiji (Mutsuhito), Taisho (Yoshihito), Showa (Hirohito)
Japan would occupy Formosa (Taiwan) by the end of the Meiji rule
By the 20th century, Japan would develop into a colonizer

Perceptions of Japan by Filipinos:
Japan as a role model
Filipino nationalists of the 19th century believed Japan could serve as a role model such as Jose Rizal

Japan as a potential ally
During the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine-American War, Filipinos sought the help of Japan
Japan would never recognize full independence and made an agreement with the US

Japan as a safe haven
Those who refused to surrender to the US and were in exile lived in Japan

Japan as a supporter of fringe nationalists
Japan was presented as an alternative to Western Imperialism. This contradicted Japan's efforts to present itself as a leader by presenting itself as a modern nation.

Japan as a source of cheap labor
During the American colonial period, Japanese people would immigrate to the Philippines.
They provided cheap labor and industrial expertise in sectors such as the abaca industry in Davao.

Japan as competition in the market
They competed against Filipino laborers and Filipino-Chinese businessmen

Japan as a brutal invader
Increasing militarism from Japan and promotion of daitoua (traditional pottery maker)
Japan, attempting to recover from the Depression, sought to expand their territories. Easiest to colonize was China which was split among warlords.
Manchuria was used as a means to expand Japanese territory.
China and Japan would be at war against each other.
Atrocities would be committed in Nanking, also known as the "Rape of Nanking"
Japanese would implement Comfort Women, sex slaves.

Quezon would also visit Japan to negotiate with the Americans.

Suspicions would be raised against Japan by Filipinos
Japan started perceiving Asia in terms of race

East Asian Race:
Fantasy of Sameness:
* Culturalism vs modernism which emphasizes materialism
* Return to traditional culture and reject western corruption

centrality of Japan:
* Japan would act as a paternal figure in East Asia
* Kokutai: imagined horizontal community with Japan on top; tied to Confucianism.
* This would extend to Japan's colonies and to Southeast Asia by WWII

spirit/Seishin:
* prioritize the internal/spirit; recognize they are part of the East Asian Race


Japanese plan to recover from the Great Depression was to acquire colonies.
They imagined the idea of the East Asian Race, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
This idea of centrality contradicts their idea of sameness. Japan perceived other countries as uncivilized, rationalizing themselves as the central figure, yet they are proposing all these nations are the same.
