# Barbarity and Civilization
## Adventures of Dankichi's Globe
The Adventures of Dankichi expresses the images held by the Japanese of the "tropics," "blackies," "the South Seas," "the uncivilized," and "barbarians" during the 1930s.
The frequent use of discriminatory terms indicates the shallowness of social consciousness regarding racial discrimination, and should not be regarded as a sign of the text's prejudice.
The author admits he held a preconceived idea that the South Seas held "dangerous beasts" and "dark-skinned headhunters."
The story consists of animals from all over the world to generate the image of the "tropics."

The story conveys Japanese Orientalism toward "the southern region," "the South Seas," and the "tropics."
Lack of national specificity was not problematic since the story was merely a type of comic.
The status of children's comics as a marginalized genre helped justify its content.

The author's idea to set the story in a "tropical region in the south" was because the Micronesian Islands were a Japanese colony at the time.
The story is directly inspired by a novell called "The Boy King in the South Seas," in which a boy becomes king of an island in the Solomon archipelago by using "tools of civilization"—mirrors, fertilizers, and pistols.

On Dankichi's globe, the south Seas was a world of "primitives," "barbarians," and "natives."

The comic tale was produced by the author's Orientalist images of the South Seas, which were shaped by ignorance and popular misconceptions.

Given the limited level of public consciousness by the 1930s, it is hard to conclude that the content of Adventures is particularly expansionist, colonialist, or racist.
The frequently used racist expressions were part of everyday language, and do not suggest that Shimada Keizō, the author, had stronger racist inclinations than others.

Adventures introduced the theme of "barbarity" discovered by "civilization" into the underground culture.
Dankichi's wristwatch—an image of the civilized— is a symbolic device that separates the characters into a hierarchical culture.

Wearing a watch, or shoes, was a relatively new phenomenon in modern Japanese history.
In 1933, it was probably very rare to see a child with a watch.
If a watch is a reflection of civilization, Japan's own civilization and enlightenment did not have such a long history for Dankichi to boast of.
Only by discovering "barbarians" could Dankichi become a "civilized individual."
By acquiring "barbarous" colonies in the South Seas could Japan come to have an awareness of itself as a "civilized nation."

# Discovering the "Native"
The mandate of Micronesia was handed over to Japan from Germany in 1920, which became a topic in Japanese textbooks.
In a letter, Takagi Ichinosuke, scholar of Japanese literature and editor of school textbooks for the Ministry of Education, writes about his life in the Truk Islands. He comments on the warm weather, presence of Japanese people, wildlife, and the "not very civilized" population.
However, he later admits that he wrote the letter without any direct knowledge of the islands, solely relied on guidebooks.

The natives that appeared in grade school textbooks prepared the way for "barbarian retainers" in Adventures.
The Japanese language in schools and the nation-state system of the empire governed the uncivilized.

The Micronesians under Japan's mandate were not the first group of "natives" that modern Japan discovered, but was the last.
Over the course of Japan's modernization, they have interacted with the Ainu, and the "Takasago tribe" in Taiwan, which became Japan's colony after the Sino-Japanese War.

The natives of the Truk Islands being described as "meek" and "easily took to [Japanese]" implies the existence of natives that were the opposite.
They point to the existence of "savages" in the Marshall Islands. Suzuki Tsunenori characterized them by cannibalism, idleness, adultery, superstition, and tattooing.
"South Seas natives" has conjured these images of an uncivilized world.

As a result of the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, two wars of colonial expansion, Japan acquired colonies, but also met with large-scale resistance from the indigenous peoples.
The tendency of Japan to disregard accountability for its modern colonial policies is seen by its trivialization of the movements as riots, and not understanding them as part of the larger anti-Japanese, anti-colonial struggle.

The Wushe Incident refers to the uprising of the "Takasago tribe" in October 1930, located in Taiwan.
On October 27, about two hundred Takasago people stormed into the playground of the Wushe local school on Sports Day, killing Japanese and attacking police and governmental offices. One hundred thirty-four Japanese were killed.
This was understood in Japanese mainland as a revolt by "the barbaric" against "the civilized" rather than the outcome of anti-Japanese movement in the colonies.
The Takasago were generally known as "savages" who practiced headhunting, adorned their bodies with tattoos, fought among their clans, and lived in conflict.

The majority of Japanese, including intellectuals, saw the incident as a manifestation of "barbarity."
The official documentation of the incident cites a broken marriage between a native and Japanese police officer as an inciting event.
It was assumed that the entire incident was a product of the imagination of the "barbarian natives," and was rooted in their barbaric brutality and lewdness.

There was a sentiment that there was not other way to educate the "barbarians" than to  enforce a policy of segregation and protection suggested in the Hokkaido Former Natives Protection Law for the Ainu.

## The Mode of Thought that Frames "Barbarism"
After the Wushe Incident, the Japanese had been awakened to their "inner barbarity."

In the piece, "The Savage," the protagonist, Tazawa, marries and Taiwanese native, and ends up beheading a native following a riot in a nearby native community.

Tazawa, the "civilized man," engages in an instinctive fight and carries out an act of "headhunting" like the Taiwanese natives. 
However, Tazawa's "savagery" is still a "transplanted sapling" compared to the natives' "colossal tree."
This is a rediscovery of modern Japan's "civilization and enlightenment" as a "transplanted civilization," as well as an awakening to the true, wild barbarity that existed before Japan's modernity.

In the early Showa period (1926-1989), the Japanese could confirm their "civilized self" by finding "barbarity" in the "savages" of the colony.
Within themselves, they were to discover a "barbarity" as a secret passion.

The problem inherent to modern Japan was that its own appropriation of a foreign culture and civilization and its project to modernize and civilize native cultures—that is, the "Orientalization" of the surrounding Asian and Pacific cultures and the de-Orientalization of Japan's own traditional/Asia-Pacific culture, which was rooted in the Asia-Pacific region—had to occur simultaneously.

The discovery of "barbarity" did not open a path for Japan to overcome the "civilization" of the West by uncovering Japan's own uncivilized nature, but only valorized barbarism within the existing framework of civilization.
Japan's enlightenment and civilization meant the transformation of other Asian-Pacific ethnicities and countries, which historically had much in common with Japanese culture, into a primitive and barbarous existence.

Imperial-power-and-colony relationships can never occur where there is no gap in stages of civilization.
Japan's colonial acquisitions followed the Western model and were always accompanied by cultural invasion and deprivations in which other countries were regarded as "barbarous," while their cultures were degraded as uncivilized.
The fanatic inculcation of Japanese spirit and emperor ideology in the colony was an expression of the inferiority complex felt by the Japanese toward the West.

# "Natives" in Asia
## Coolies, Beggars, and Opium Addicts
Invited by Nakamura Korekimi, also known as Zekō, then-president of the South Manchurian Railway Company, Natsume Sōseki visited Korea and Manchuria in 1909.
In a letter, Sōseki writes, that upon entering Manchuria, he sees Chinese workers, who he describes as "filthy," "unsightly" coolies.
Manchuria was first recognized as a very dirty place in the eyes Japanese, and "Chinks" were equated with "filthy" coolies.

Sōseki's sentiments towards the Chinese were similar, if not worse, than British woman Isabella Bird's when visiting Japan in 1878.

Although still discriminatory, Bird's gaze captures the Ainu as "humans."
Bird attempted to overcome the gap between the civilized and the primitive by the concept of universal humanity.
The Japanese, who were supposed to be only marginally civilized themselves, painted the "uncivilized" peoples with the images of "dogs."

Imaeda Setsuo's Strange Stories from Manchuria is a guide book that reports on prostitutes, opium addicts, thieves' markets, and the like of each Manchurian city.
This book was heavily associated with official slogans such as "Cooperation of Five Peoples" and "Asian Paradise by Moral Rule."
The dark, social aspects of Manchukuo was valued entirely for its sensationalism.
The only thing found in the book is a gaze that fully intends to de-familiarize Manchuria, Manchukuo, and Manchurians.
Paradoxically, the book should be valued for its mockery of the official state slogans.

In a book called Dissection of Taikan'en, a report declares that every kind of vice and misery can be found in the "Manchurian residential zone" in Harbin.
He describes a place called Taikan'en, where morphine addicts, sex workers, gambling, vagabonds, opium dens, morphine dealers, beggars, thieves, and corpses are commonplace.
Taikan'en was the exact opposite of the ideal of "Asian Paradise by Moral Rule."

The author connects the existence of Taikan'en and Fujiaden, the representative of the largest criminal underground of Manchukuo, to the ethnic character of the Han, despite the fact that we now know that the degree of slums and the like corresponds to the level of political and economic development.
He describes the Japanese as people who keep the "individual character pure" while the China's society are "thoroughly instinct-based."
This cultural argument conceals the national scale acts by Japanese who conspired to obtain large sums of money by taking advantage of the corruption in China.
Eguchi Keiichi writes in his book Sino-Japan Opium War that the Japanese military and merchants were behind those Koreans and Chinese who participated in the morphine and opium dealings.
Racism may be hidden in the objectivity of cultural theory and cultural comparison.

These three writings on the Manchurians—a travel essay, a popular travel guide, and social research—seeks to place the Manchurian people in an inferior position to the Japanese by emphasizing their "immorality" and "filth."
It is a gaze that regards all people other than their won as subhuman and animalistic.

Japan had a history of regarding china as a developed, civilized country, which is why they had to treat the modern Chinese as "native."
Japan was influenced by Chinese characters, Confucianism, Buddhism, codes of etiquette, cultural artifacts, arts, clothing, city planning, and social institutions.
Historical, cultural inferiority could not be overcome without proving Japan's cultural superiority.

## Culture and Discrimination
The tendency to dismiss non-Japanese as "native" gradually intensified as Japan accelerated imperial indoctrination based on an emperor-centered historical view.

An 1878 notice by the Hokkaido Development Commissioner officially renamed the Ainu "former natives," "elevating" their status from "native."
"Former natives," in effect, meant "common people."
The concept of "former natives" emerged in modern Japanese history with that of "new common people," which as given exclusively to former outcasts, giving a new name to the old discrimination.

In 1922, a novel realistically depicts Koreans as large as life and Korean farmers' suffering in a multilayered fashion, but at the same time regards them as "primitive" with his use of the term "native."

The author also linked the term "native" with Korean culture, leading to a culturalist hierarchy.

There was a sense of contempt for and ethnic superiority over the Koreans among Japanese immigrants after the annexation of Korea in 1910.
Discrimination existed officially and unofficially, in contrast to slogans such as "Same Love for All" and "Japan-Korea, United Body."
The modern Japan that attempted to achieve "Leaving Asia, Entering Europe" created a mental structure that allowed them to regard non-Japanese Asians as "native" in an attempt to negate their own origins and to adopt Western modernity.

The function of journalism then was to discuss cultural differences, promote prejudice and discrimination, and provide arguments for a hierarchical cultural comparison.
The book Complete Collection of Strange Customs in the World has a section on marriage customs.
It describes mainland Chinese customs, although referred to as Taiwanese, such as the coming of age ceremony, the adoption system, and the "extremely barbaric" custom in which headhunting is assigned to the son-in-law as a condition of marriage.
It also describes the custom of "son-in-law hazing" and the practice of marrying older wives of Korea.

These unusual customs are introduced bases solely on sensationalism, viewed through prejudice and a discriminatory consciousness.
Cultural differences are turned into an order of superiority.
Paradoxically, these types of marriage customs can be observed in rural Japan.
Such moves were intended to exaggerate strangeness in order to prove the cultural superiority of the Japanese.

Modern Japan's views of Asia was distorted by the persistent impetus to "leave Asia."

The Japanese never acknowledged themselves as "Japanese natives."

The Japanese abandoned the commonsensical notion that one cannot easily establish superiority of ethnic culture, and the presence of various cultures, grouping together those who are considered culturally inferior.
They disregarded the fact that Indian, Chinese, and Korean culture greatly influenced Japan.

For writer Takami Jun, in the novel Ethnic Peoples, he uses the term "native" as a curse.
This illustrates how common it was for Japanese who went to Asia during the war to mistreat Asians as "natives."

When Takada Taijun was mobilized to the Chinese front as a Japanese soldier, he describes the faces of the Chinese in his essay "The Faces of the Dirt Peasants."
He saw a culture of "people who live with the earth," and "poverty-stricken dirt peasants."
The terms "natives" and "dirt peasants" are not equal, illustrating a gap between two different views of Asia by the Japanese.

The Japanese called Europeans and Americans "demon-beasts" and Asians in the colonies as "natives."
These terms were derived from the pride of the Japanese, who defined themselves as "humans" and "civilized people."
These terms are also an attempt to conceal Japan's goal of "Leaving Asia, Entering Europe" by extracting themselves from the "native kingdom" in the backwaters of Asia.
The "Japanese" versus "native."
