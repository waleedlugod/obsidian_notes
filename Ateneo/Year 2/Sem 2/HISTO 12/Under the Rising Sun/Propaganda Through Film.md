Propaganda Corps created a "Central Booking Office" which was a consolidation of the eleven branch offices for US film distributing companies.
It was established to manage the income from US films and to absorb the employees of these offices.

Japanese feature films started to be shown after the Manila Branch of Nihon Eiga Haikyu Sha was set up in December 1942.

Japanese films can be divided into six categories:
1. Films propagating the superiority of the Japanese military power;
2. Films appealing for cooperation with Japan, clothed in love stories;
3. Films depicting the racial discrimination of British and Americans against Asians;
4. Films focusing on industrial strength;
5. Films portraying love story, fantasy, domestic life and others;
6. Japan's Leadership under the GEACS.
Movies depicting everyday domestic life did not appeal to the Filipinos at all.

Japanese films were advertised in newspapers and magazines.

Cultural films were also shown.
Films were brought to the provinces by mobile units.

Films were made in Japan before and after the War broke out.
Films categorized as "national policy films" had to meet the following qualifications:
1. Elimination of individualistic tendencies, which were influences of European-American films;
2. Exaltation of the Japanese spirit, specially the tradition of the family system and the national spirit, which is dedicated to the cause of the country;
3. Reeducation of the nation, specially of modern Japanese women who have been Europeanized, and thus lost the feelings unique to the Japanese;
4. Extermination of flippant utterances and actions, and injection of the idea of respect for the elders.

In 1940, the Department of the Interior declared a total ban on the following themes:
individual happiness, lives of the wealthy, women smoking or drinking in public places, vocabularies with foreign influences, flippant actions, and so forth.
Moves focusing on the productive sector, specially on farming life, was encouraged.

Dawn of Freedom was a locally-made Japanese film.
Japanese authorities decided to produce films locally because they shared a belief with a movie critic who declared that Japanese films could not replace American films in terms of available numbers.
They also felt that Japanese films were too full of subtle undertones which would be difficult to understand, unlike US films.

# Dawn of Freedom
Authorities wanted to stress the fall of the American hold in Asia and the eventual expulsion of American culture from the entire East Asia.

Scenes showed American soldiers burning villages and Filipinos chained.
American prisoners of war were forced to appear in the movie.

Also known as Down with That Flag, Liwayway ng Kalayaan, and Dwon with the Stars and Stripes.
The Japanese title Ano Hata o Ute is said to be based on a symbolic incident during the battle of Corregidor.
The US Flag was show down after twenty-four days of attack.

# A Filipino's View of Japanese Films
ABL Rosales noted that women and love were common topics in Filipino films.
In Japanese films, women were not featured much, and were shown chains the men they love.
Filipino films emphasized on the love life of the central characters and placed great value of a few persons.
Japanese films did not put love if it went against the main theme of the film.

He also commented that Japanese would not make use of costly like Hollywood movies.
Japanese used a lot of nature and everyday scenes.
Japanese were not fond of displaying inner feelings, unlike Hollywood films, which were more morbid.
Japanese films were also slow, and portrayed honesty, loyalty to the Emperor and the country, loyalty and respect for one's parents, integrity of character, generosity of feelings and the spirit of sacrifice.
Filipinos viewed Japanese movies as boring.
