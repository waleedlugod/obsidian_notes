Posters, leaflets, pictorials, and editorial cartoons were greatly used for propaganda by the Allies and Axis powers.

In the Philippines, print, music, film, and other media were used to win Filipino loyalty by the Commonwealth, the US, and Japan.

Prior to WWII, the Commonwealth government circulated few posters, which provided information on how to prepare for air raids, the necessity of planting food crops, loyalty to the US, and pride in being Filipino.

# Propaganda in the First Month of War
When the war broke out, the Filipino response was overwhelmingly to fight.
The Philippines had been attacked shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, outrage was reflected in images of Filipinos armed.
The war was seen as self-defense, a nationalistic war.
An editorial cartoon in the Philippines Free Press shows how the Filipinos in 1941 were inspired the same nationalistic ideals the revolutionaries had in 1896.
A monument in the background symbolized the cry for Filipino independence, often used by the Commonwealth and the Japanese-sponsored republic.

The aims of Filipino early war visual propaganda were to vent the anger of the people, and inspire them to fight by giving meaning to the struggle.
Since the fighting occurred during Christmas season, signs of Christmas were used in propaganda.

Outside Manila, the same sentiments can be felt.

# Japanese Propaganda
The Japanese Sendenbu distributed leaflets explaining their cause.
In one leaflet, a Japanese soldiers light a cigarette for a Filipino soldier with American troops fleeing in the background.
The Japanese sought to cause conflict between the Filipinos and the Americans.

Other leaflets tried to convince that siding with the Americans was wrong, recalling the atrocities of the Filipino-American War.

Other warns Filipinos not to blindly follow the Americans.

As American treatment of the Filipinos were not too bad, as seen in 1941, weaning Filipino loyalty proved difficult.
Japanese propaganda turned towards sex appeal, which also failed as soldiers were starving.

More effective leaflets were those that appealed to hunger.
However, Filipinos soldiers continued to fight, until the Japanese launched military offensives that crushed the resistance.
Many leaflets were ordered to be destroyed, to they are extremely scarce today.
However, leaflets were used as toilet paper, which was nonexistent in the front-lines.

Organized resistance ended with the invasion of Corregidor in May 1942, and the Japanese moved to win the loyalty of the Filipinos.
One line was to show how Japan aimed to free the Asian peoples ([[Inventing the East Asian Race]]).

One pamphlet aimed to inform that Japan also had Catholics.

With the capturing of the Philippines, Japanese propaganda tried to convince the Filipinos of a new order.
They claimed that peace was restored, however, this was enforced by Japanese arms.

The propaganda corps also nurtured Filipino nationalism by celebrating Filipino holidays, such as the anniversary of the martyrdom of Rizal.
Filipinos were also urged to take pride in manual work.
These sentiments were reinforced with Japanese ideals, such as Japanese centrality.

Propaganda corps also renamed the Department of Information in 1942, and continued the demonizing the Americans.
One poster charged the US with bombing the Vatican, which was later proven false by news broadcasts.

# Filipino Propaganda Under the Japanese
Part of the politico-cultural policy of Japan was to grant independence, on paper.
This resulted in the 1943 Japanese-sponsored Republic of the Philippines, with Jose P. Laurel as president.
Filipinos were also drafted into the Japanese propaganda machine via the Bureau of Information and Public Security.
The BIPS designed a poster celebrating independence under Laurel, bolstering patriotism, which had no sign of Japanese presence.

Another poster showed the Philippine flag along with a chrysanthemums, a symbol of Japan.
 The BIPS appealed to Filipino nationalism, honoring Filipino heroes.
 One leaflet shown a monument to remember Filipino prisoners of war who died in prison camps after surrendering to the Japanese in 1942.

The Japanese occupation used the Philippine flag to awaken Filipino pride in the Laurel administration.

Most BIPS artists were Filipino, and famed artists sometimes had no choice but to work with the Japanese.
One work of Francisco "Botong" Francisco, under the direction of Victorio Edades, showed that the Constabulary was pro-Filipino and strong, despite it being weak and used by the Japanese against guerrillas.

When Americans began bombing Japanese positions in the Philippines in August 1944, Japanese propagandists blamed Americans for killing Filipino civilians and destroying churches.
However, Filipinos were overjoyed at the return of American planes.

Few Filipinos took the propaganda and those who made them seriously.
Those who did were collectors of Filipiniana.

# Anti-Japanese Propaganda
More effective propaganda were hand-drawn leaflets by Filipino guerrillas, exposing Japanese lies.
Another leaflet showed greed to be the real motivator for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

One leaflet showed Japanese soldiers looting a shackled Juan de la Cruzâ€”a typical Filipino citizen.

Another shown that violence would prevail under Japanese-sponsored independence.
This image was so powerful that it was also used under martial law in the 1970s.
The illustrator and writer were thrown into prison and tortured.

Other images ridiculed Japan's readiness to fight in the Philippines.
Another depicted guerrillas as patriotic fighters against the Japanese.
Another depicted a map showing the latest American advances, disproving claims of the Japanese controlled press.

# American Propaganda
General MacArthur circulated cigarettes, matchbooks, pencils, and magazines with the promise "I shall return" along with an image of him, designed by the Psychological Warfare Branch.

The PWB effort was also directed towards the Japanese, Taiwanese, and Koreans.
Leaflets contrasted US goals with that of Japan and the Lauren government.

In one case, the Americans used Japanese war notes, which were almost valueless, to symbolize the emptiness of Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, stamping "The Co-Prosperity Sphere: What is it Worth?" on them.

Another leaflet showed the US flag on one side and the Philippine flag on the other.

The return of the Americans was informed via leaflets.
As American leaflets did not contain verifiable falsehoods, they succeeded in building morale and confidence in MacArthur's forces.
The Japanese banned these leaflets, and being caught meant death or torture.
American leaflets were kept by Filipinos, which symbolized real liberation.

# Commonwealth Government in Exile
The Commonwealth government also produced propaganda material.
Manuel Rey Isip, a Filipino commercial artist in Hollywood, was asked to paint an image benefiting the Filipino resistance.
The poster was distributed in the US to rekindle the Philippine memory.
