Huk renamed to Hukbong Magpapalaya sa Bayan
Core members: Castro Alejandrino, Juan Feleo, eusebio Aquino, Mariano Franco, Bernardo Poblete, Felipa Culala (Dayang-Dayang), Celia Mariano, Nieves Fernandez
Woman's rights was a core idea of the movement; the whole movement was considered as family.

Near the end of the war, the Huks helped the Americans capture towns in Central Luzon.
Immediately after the war, Huk leaders were targeted by the government.
Prior to WWII, landlords would call on the Constabulary to suppress peasant movements, but after the war, the peasants learned military tactics.
Government attempted to disarm the Huks.
Huks joined the elections to gain power, so they formed alliances with Osmena; Osmena was a reelectionist.

Democratic Alliance:
Nacionalista, PKP (Jesus Lava), HMB

Roxas was a Japanese collaborator and was part a powerful landowning clan, so there was hostilities with the Huks when he won the 1946 elections.

1945: Luis Taruc and other Huk leaders are arrested. They are released in September 1945.
1946: Presidential Elections. Huks supported Osmena's presidential bid. Roxas won. Huks allies in Congress are disqualified by the Roxas administration. Juan Feleo assassinated. Huk Rebellion began.
Huks were denied their seats, despite winning their elections, so Huks negotiated.

Taruc's conditions to submit to the state:
1. The right of every citizen to keep and bear arms should, for the present, be recognized
2. All private armed groups should be disbanded and every member should register his firearm
3. But in the transition period, to protect the barrio people from the depredations fo any armed bands, every barrio should be permitted to form self-defense units
4. All charges against members of the Huk and other guerrilla organizations for actions take in the collective interest during the Jap regime and up to the present should be dismissed
5. All anti-peasant local officials should be removed and replaced by at least impartial elements
6. So as to enable the masses of Central Luzon  to voice their needs an their feeling in the democratic way, all their Congressmen should be seated
7. The constitutional liberties of individuals which have been arbitrarily abolished by local officials should be restored, while all ordinances which nullify these liberties should immediately be declared null and void

Juan Feleo was kidnapped and killed, who was a core Huk member.
Roxas respnded that the Huks were at fault for Feleo's kidnapping.
Huks returned to the mountains and resisted the government.

Huk rebellion started in 1946.
Many peasants joined the Huks because they were being harassed by government forces.

1948: Roxas died of heart attack. Quirino became president and offered amnesty to all Huk rebels. Negotiations between the Quirino administration and the Huks began.
Quirino also started forming alliances with local warlord clans, who were eventually elected in the Congress and Senate.
Quirino was forced to release a statement about his corruption issues.
Quirino won one of the most violent elections in Philippine history.

1949: Negotiations collapse. Huks formed alliance with PKP. 1949 Presidential Elections won by Quirino. Violence throughout Central Luzon
Connections with PKP allowed funding from foreign powers (Soviet Union)
PKP did not believe the Huk rebellion will win a  communist revolution
PKP saw the possibility of Huks winning with the rebellion since many Huks were located near or at Quezon City, the capital at the time.

1951: Peak of the rebellion. Huks on the vicinity of Quezon City, the new capital of the Republic. Quirino appointed Magsaysay as Defense Secretary.
Through the CIA, the Americans repackaged Magsaysay's image as a warlord to a "man of the masses."
Peasants wanted protection that was lost at the start of peasant rebellions, which was a recognition of their dignity.
Magsaysay pushed for unethical policies such as the use of psy-war against the Huks
Magsaysay portrayed Huks as being hunted by aswangs, by hanging their bodies, and convincing peasantry to not support the Huk movement.

Ninoy Aquino became Magsaysay's representative for the Huks.

1954: End of Huk Rebellion under the presidency of Ramon Magsaysay.
Magsaysay shifted to Nacionalista party
Although PKP sympathized with the peasants, they viewed them as lower.
Most Huks surrendered to the government, but some still resisted and became private armies.
The private armies were named after bands, the most powerful named The Beatles, and the government's named Monkees.

RA 1700 Anti-Subversion Act
An act to outlaw the Communist Party of the Philippines and similar associations, penalizing membership therein, and for other purposes.

HMB
Cesario Manarang: Kumander Alibasbas
Faustino del Mundo: Kumander Sumulong
Bernabe Buscayno: Kumander Dante
Alibasbas and Sumulong became rivals and formed their own armies.
Sumulong supported Ferdinand Marcos, but was later eliminated during the Martial Law as he was seen as a threat.
Dante, disappointed with Sumulong's alliance with Marcos, formed Bagong Hukbong Magpapalaya ng Bayan-1969 (New People's Army)

Huk veterans claimed that the Huk rebellion was not a failure, as "We showed them (the landlords and government) we weren't slaves. WE didn't lie down like whimpering dogs when they started to ship us. We stood up and fought for what is rightfully ours... No strike, no demonstration, no rebellion fails. Protest against injustice always succeeds."

Huks, allied with communists, were not a communist insurgency, as they their ideals did not align, and wanted their dignity recognized.
