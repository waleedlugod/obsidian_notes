July 4, 1946, Philippines gained independence, with Manual Roxas as president

# Presidential elections
Six presidents: Manuel Roxas (Liberal), Elpidio Quirino (Liberal), Ramon Magsaysay (Nacionalista), Carlos Garcia (Nacionalista), Diosdado Macapagal (Liberal), Ferdinand Marcos (Nacionalista)
Presidents came from nacionalista or liberal party
Weak party system, common for politicians to switch parties

Running mate of Roxas was Quirino, both collaborators

All presidents except Garcia had majority vote as usually had two major candidates part of  the main parties
Election during Garcia had three main candidates

# Vice presidential elections
Elidio Quirino (Liberal), Fernando Lopez (Liberal), Carlos Garcia (Nacionalista), Diosdado Macapagal (Liberal), Emmanuel Pelaez (Liberal), Fernando Lopez (Nacionalista)

Lopez combined bussiness with politics
Quirino sold ABS to the Lopez family, CBN, to combine the networks, to convince to join as running mate

Jose Laurel Jr. and Sergio Osmena Jr. also ran

Building blocks of politics are political clans not parties

# Concerns
## Economic
Engagement in the global market without the help of the US
Trade relations with the US
Negotiate for reparations payments from the US and Japan
Industrialization

Philippine Trade Act 1946:
* Prefential tariffs on US products
* US controls dollar-peso exchange rate. Rate is fixed at 2 Pesos for 1 Dollar
* Parity rights given to American citizens
* Raising sugar quota exports to the United States

Laurel-Langley Agreement of 1955:
* US lost control over the peso-dollar exchange rate
* Philippine goods smth

Fiscal policy: revenue and expenditure; government (Finance department)
Monetary policy: circulating money; Central Bank
US control Philippine competition in the global market due to their control over the dollar-peso exchange rate

### Industrialization
labor force in factories rather from farms

Cuaderno proposed import substitution (manufacture imported goods)
Araneta proposed export-oriented economy
Argentina modeled import substitution
Japan modeled export-oriented

Export-oriented was unpopular due to inflation and hesitance to increase wages and invest in infrastructure
Embrace export-oriented during martial law era, but was too late due to price increase of oil

## Security
### Internal
Peasant Unrest
Mindanao Independence Movement
### External
Shift of the Cold War to Asia
Diplomatic clash with neighbors

Goal to create a stronger Philippine state
