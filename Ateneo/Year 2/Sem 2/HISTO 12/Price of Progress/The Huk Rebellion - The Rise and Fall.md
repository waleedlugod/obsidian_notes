HMD leaders in Manila for negotiations fled to Central Luzon, followed by government soldiers.
The Quirino government vowed that the peasant "insurgents" would be eradicated.
Huk leaders and HMB "security forces" lived in the Sierra Madre mountains.
The band of guerrillas struggled with hunger.

Villagers in the lowlands of Central Luzon continued to rebel.

The rebellion reached its peak during 1951, fading away after that.
Many rebels simply left their HMB squads, other surrendered or were captured, others killed in battles that grew numerous during the 1950s.
Many who had supported the HMB became ambivalent.
People who continued to resist retreated into the mountains, farther away from the people who were their source of strength.

# San Ricardo and Talavera
In 1949-1951, in San Ricardo, it became increasingly dangerous to form as the number of soldiers increased.
Rice production decreased, and peasants still feared the Constabulary, who continued to loot.
Landlords moved, leaving their land to the protection of hired guards and government troops.
Tensions between the Constabulary and barrios residents increased.

San Ricardo was one of the strongest HMB barrios, and could call on other squadrons in the province so the PC were hesitant to venture into the area.

By 1949 and 1951, HMB in San Ricardo became somewhat stronger.
The government unsuccessfully tried to impose their own barrio organization, just as they tried in other barrios in Central Luzon.

Core leadership called "section committee" or "seccom" were in Talavera.
Talavera leaders communicated through letters with leaders in other municipalities and the "regional committee" or "reco" which incorporated Nueva Ecija and adjacent provinces.
Talavera leadership were peasants who previously had been in the PKM, Democratic Alliance, or Hukbalahap.

People continued to join HMB out of anger, revenge, and a desire to protect themselves against the PC.

The November 1949 national election campaign caused HMB's numbers increased.
Quirino conducted a bloody election, leading people to join HMB to protect themselves.
Villagers Talavera also held the belief that Quirino stole the election.

The HMB official position in the 1949 election supported Senator Jose Laurel for presidency, although, people in San Ricardo did not want him to be president.
Laruel was regarded as a collaborator and against the Hukbalahap as he was president during the Japanese occupation.
Other favored Laurel since Quirino's administration was so oppressive.

HMB also had violent movements.
They ambushed PC patrols and civilian guards, hijacked trucks and cars, stole money, and once tried to destroy the PC provincial command post in Cabanatuan.
Some reported unnecessary violence from their hot-headed companions.

Most HMB members leanred guerrilla tactics from experience and companions, little had formal training.

During a session in an HMB school, the instructors, one of whom were part of the PKP, told several HMB leaders that anting-anting (amulets) and superstitions were harmful.
They said that rebels who used anting-anting abandoned their comrades as they should not see blood.
However, when told to stop using anting-anting, HMB rebels refused.
Some of the best guerrillas wore anting-anting and were very superstitious.

The school ended early as it was discovered by the PC.

In the late 1940s, the HMB in Talavera gained contacts inside the municipal government.
Mayor 
Leopoldo Diaz tried to moderate the excesses of the military.
By November 1951, chapters of HMB died down.

Many peasants who joined HMB wanted to protect themselves and favored agrarian reforms; they did not become more radical during the rebellion.

Peasants also grew tired of the turmoil and retired from guerrilla life.
There was little hope that the revolt could make more progress.

Changes in the military further undermined the rebellion.
Improvements in the rebellion was attributed to Ramon Magsaysay when he was secretary of defense in the Quirino administration.
Former rebels and nonrebels claimed that Magsaysay "cleaned up the PC and Philippine army" so that soldiers no longer stole from peasants, "got rid of the civilian guards," "promised amnesty to Huks and kept his word about it," and "understood that we weren't criminals and that we wanted only what was rightfully ours."
Magsaysay also began to implement agrarian reforms.
Peasants believed that Magsaysay would allow tenats to keep up to 70 percent of harvest upon his presidency.
When the government purchased the de Leon hacienda in Talavera, they promised tenants the opportunity to buy land for their own.

These improvements reduced HMB support, even among those sympathetic to the movement.
By 1952, Roberto Aspia returned to full-time tenant farming "because Magsaysay guaranteed amnesty and had eliminated all the civilian guards."

Government forces pursued Huks where they had not done before, and did so with fewer abuses against villagers.
By 1953, only scattered bands of armed rebels remained in the vicinity of Talavera, and most were cut off from the barrios that previously supported them.
Rebels had no time for anything other than trying to survive.

Most HMB rebels who survived returned to village life.
HMB fought for the formation of peasant unions such as Masaka, a continuation of the PKM.
Peasants wanted to resist through agrarian reforms not violence.
Other peasants had become less sympathetic to the Huks when solidarity was needed.

# The Peak: 1949-1951
Two themes in Central Luzon emerged: the movement reached its peak in 1949-1951 following the alliance between the HMB and the PKB; and support for the movement decreased since the military became more selective of who they shot and officials appeared more sympathetic to the peasants' struggles.
The HMP-PKB alliance was precarious at best, and tensions increased between them.

Armed Huks numbered between eleven thousand and fifteen thousand, and roughly equal to the armed strangth of the earlier Huk resistance army.
The problem during the time wasn't lack of people but insufficient ammunition, guns, money, and supplies.
