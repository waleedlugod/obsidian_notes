Global liberalism started to balance political and economic rights via a new liberal emphasis on economic planning.

Planning was a new liberal consensus emerging from liberalism's nature as modus vivendi.
In the late 19th century, the emergence of socialist parties brought the class blinders of the liberal democratic state into focus.
Grassroots nationalism exposed liberalism's inability to contain the energies of vastly new forms of politics, which it previously ignored.
Proletarian socialism (Communism and the Soviet Union) and grassroots nationalism (fascism and Nazism) because political challenges to liberal democracy in the 20th century.
WWII banished Nazism but the Cold War placed Communism at the forefront of liberal politics.

The Great Depression triggered a crisis in liberal economic and supported Communism's claims of being immune to capitalism's boom-bust cycles.

The Depression highlighted the need for liberalism to form their own economic planning.
This was guided by John Maynard Keynes based on the gold standard and expansionary economic policy.
Through the New Deal, a form of Keynesianism, adopted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the US escaped the Depression, and placed economic welfare at the heart of American liberalism.

Keynesianism was a blow to free-market an austerity economics.

Western policy makers had a firm belief that their prosperity could be shared with the margins of the global system.
They were not imperialists but policy makers who believed countries like the Philippines could benefits from economic models like the New Deal.

Alvador Araneta was the medium through which economic ideas such as Keynesianism, New Deal liberalism, and economic planning.
His ideas were highly debated in the 1950s, a period of economic and political decolonization, when the Philippines was first attempting to formulate industrial policy.
Araneta was a Filipino New Dealer and Keynesian who beloved in expansionary government policy, seeking government credit to finance industry and employment.
Keynesianism was not and barely understood.
His ideas collided with the conservative Philippine Central Bank and its governor, Miguel Cuaderno, who advocated a policy of strict austerity.
They arguments are now called the "Great Debate" of postwar Philippine economics.

The debate had high stakes that affected the long-term economic policy development, and had arguments close to eternal, referencing events such as the collapse of the Greek economy.
The debate was between austerity and expansionism.

Both Araneta nd Cuderno operted within the American-influenced liberal climate of postwar Philippines.
The Great Debate mirrored debates within American liberalism concerning the role of government in an economy after the Great Depression.
The debate was about the future of the liberal tradition.

# The Burdens of the Cacique Life
Salvador Zaragoza Araneta was part of the group of ilustrados who collaborated with the American occupiers to form the pro-annexation Partido Federal.

Araneta had a privileged life.
He lived in a downtown Manila home that hosted banquets for Sec. of War William Howard Taft and Gov. Gen. William Cameron Forbes.

Araneta married within his class to Victoria Lopez, daughter to one of Iloilo's most prestigious Chinese mestizo families.
Araneta would cultivate joint business relations through his wife.

Araneta received a religious education, with a BA from Ateneo, and licenciado en derecho from the royal and pontifical UST.
From 1922 to 1923, he was a special student at Harvard, where he audited courses in Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, and Commercial Law.
He was practicing in his father's firm from 1923 until 1941.
During the Japanese occupation, he began considering economics, and became a businessman.

Araneta's economic ideas were largely self-taught.
In the 1950s, he often referred to John Maynard Keynes, William Beveridge, FDR, and the New Deal in his writings.
In the late 1960s, after the Great Debate, he became a disciple of Louis O. Kelso, who was a lawyer-cum-economist-cum-businessman and an advocate of Keynesianism and "worker capitlaism."
As with Keynes, Araneta's progressivism was more rooted in noblesse oblige and peity than in class solidarity.

Araneta was a member of the 1934 Constitutional Convention, where he advocated for the nationalization of the retail trade.
During negotiations of trade relations between the US and the Philippines, Araneta was one of the most vocal advocates of continuing preferential trade.

In September 1950, Araneta was appointed Secretary of Economic Coordination.
He later resigned the following year after an fight with the president over the issue of exporting sugar to Japan.
When Magsaysay became president in 1953, Araneta became Secretary of Agriculture, but resigned the year after due to the growing tensions with labor gorups and fiscal conservatives in the administration.
Magsaysay then appointed him a part-time position in the National Economic Council, which he left in 1956 after perceiving that his policy recommendations had become marginalized.
Despite his time in government, Araneta was primarily a businessman and industrialist, and had major ties to the powerful sugar lobby.
He at one point served as the director of the Lopez Sugar Central.

Araneta also founded Far East Air Transport Inc. University, and the National Economic Protection Association.
During martial law, he was a critic of the Marcos dictatorship, and was exiled in San Francisco and later Vancouver.

Araneta was the platonic image of the Spanish-mestizo elite.
He described himself as a proud man, sure of himself, and quick to take offense, which kept him away from extended office in government, where he exhibited an insubordinate streak.

Araneta was prophetic, defending expansionary economic policy at a time hen austerity was mainstream.

After Carlos P. Romulo, no work has revisited Araneta's ideas.
The few shcolars who discussed him dismissed his ideas because he was a member of the oligarchic, landowning "cacique" class.

Araneta's bête noir was Central Bank's Miguel Cuaderno, who had been favorably represented in recent historical work.
Yusuke Takagi portrays him as an effective technocrat, successfully navigating ecnomic decolonization and the foriging of state institutions.
Cuaderno emerges as the disinterested technocrat defending state strength, while his foes (Araneta was the biggest) became agents of the state's weakness.

The nuances within intra-elite debates had immense effects on the development of the Philippine economy—effects, which, naturally, extended beyond the elite.

The Great Debate concerned monetary and fiscal policy, and assessing it require an examination of macroeconomic strategy and its effects.
History of macroeconomic policy, from the New Deal to Japan's developmental state, proves that further factors, other than corruption and rent-seeking, enabled an interventionist state.

# Economic Planning and Economic Literacy in the 1950s
The Philippine Economy in the 1950s was in the process of decolonization.
The US made postwar rehabilitation aid contingent on the signing of the infamous Bell Trade Act which limited Philippine exports to the US, denied the Philippines tariff and currency autonomy, and granted special economic privileges to American investors and traders..
Although modified in 1955, the new treaty maintained parity rights for American businessmen in the Philippines, causing massive trade deficits.
Demand for rehabilitation and consumer goods were high, but there was little to produce either for local consumption or for export.
