Global liberalism started to balance political and economic rights via a new liberal emphasis on economic planning.

Planning was a new liberal consensus emerging from liberalism's nature as modus vivendi.
In the late 19th century, the emergence of socialist parties brought the class blinders of the liberal democratic state into focus.
Grassroots nationalism exposed liberalism's inability to contain the energies of vastly new forms of politics, which it previously ignored.
Proletarian socialism (Communism and the Soviet Union) and grassroots nationalism (fascism and Nazism) because political challenges to liberal democracy in the 20th century.
WWII banished Nazism but the Cold War placed Communism at the forefront of liberal politics.

The Great Depression triggered a crisis in liberal economic and supported Communism's claims of being immune to capitalism's boom-bust cycles.

The Depression highlighted the need for liberalism to form their own economic planning.
This was guided by John Maynard Keynes based on the gold standard and expansionary economic policy.
Through the New Deal, a form of Keynesianism, adopted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the US escaped the Depression, and placed economic welfare at the heart of American liberalism.

Keynesianism was a blow to free-market an austerity economics.

Western policy makers had a firm belief that their prosperity could be shared with the margins of the global system.
They were not imperialists but policy makers who believed countries like the Philippines could benefits from economic models like the New Deal.

Alvador Araneta was the medium through which economic ideas such as Keynesianism, New Deal liberalism, and economic planning.
His ideas were highly debated in the 1950s, a period of economic and political decolonization, when the Philippines was first attempting to formulate industrial policy.
Araneta was a Filipino New Dealer and Keynesian who beloved in expansionary government policy, seeking government credit to finance industry and employment.
Keynesianism was not and barely understood.
His ideas collided with the conservative Philippine Central Bank and its governor, Miguel Cuaderno, who advocated a policy of strict austerity.
They arguments are now called the "Great Debate" of postwar Philippine economics.

The debate had high stakes that affected the long-term economic policy development, and had arguments close to eternal, referencing events such as the collapse of the Greek economy.
The debate was between austerity and expansionism.

Both Araneta nd Cuderno operted within the American-influenced liberal climate of postwar Philippines.
The Great Debate mirrored debates within American liberalism concerning the role of government in an economy after the Great Depression.
The debate was about the future of the liberal tradition.

# The Burdens of the Cacique Life
Salvador Zaragoza Araneta was part of the group of ilustrados who collaborated with the American occupiers to form the pro-annexation Partido Federal.

Araneta had a privileged life.
He lived in a downtown Manila home that hosted banquets for Sec. of War William Howard Taft and Gov. Gen. William Cameron Forbes.

Araneta married within his class to Victoria Lopez, daughter to one of Iloilo's most prestigious Chinese mestizo families.
Araneta would cultivate joint business relations through his wife.

Araneta received a religious education, with a BA from Ateneo, and licenciado en derecho from the royal and pontifical UST.
From 1922 to 1923, he was a special student at Harvard, where he audited courses in Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, and Commercial Law.
He was practicing in his father's firm from 1923 until 1941.
During the Japanese occupation, he began considering economics, and became a businessman.

Araneta's economic ideas were largely self-taught.
In the 1950s, he often referred to John Maynard Keynes, William Beveridge, FDR, and the New Deal in his writings.
In the late 1960s, after the Great Debate, he became a disciple of Louis O. Kelso, who was a lawyer-cum-economist-cum-businessman and an advocate of Keynesianism and "worker capitlaism."
As with Keynes, Araneta's progressivism was more rooted in noblesse oblige and peity than in class solidarity.

Araneta was a member of the 1934 Constitutional Convention, where he advocated for the nationalization of the retail trade.
During negotiations of trade relations between the US and the Philippines, Araneta was one of the most vocal advocates of continuing preferential trade.

In September 1950, Araneta was appointed Secretary of Economic Coordination.
He later resigned the following year after an fight with the president over the issue of exporting sugar to Japan.
When Magsaysay became president in 1953, Araneta became Secretary of Agriculture, but resigned the year after due to the growing tensions with labor gorups and fiscal conservatives in the administration.
Magsaysay then appointed him a part-time position in the National Economic Council, which he left in 1956 after perceiving that his policy recommendations had become marginalized.
Despite his time in government, Araneta was primarily a businessman and industrialist, and had major ties to the powerful sugar lobby.
He at one point served as the director of the Lopez Sugar Central.

Araneta also founded Far East Air Transport Inc. University, and the National Economic Protection Association.
During martial law, he was a critic of the Marcos dictatorship, and was exiled in San Francisco and later Vancouver.

Araneta was the platonic image of the Spanish-mestizo elite.
He described himself as a proud man, sure of himself, and quick to take offense, which kept him away from extended office in government, where he exhibited an insubordinate streak.

Araneta was prophetic, defending expansionary economic policy at a time hen austerity was mainstream.

After Carlos P. Romulo, no work has revisited Araneta's ideas.
The few shcolars who discussed him dismissed his ideas because he was a member of the oligarchic, landowning "cacique" class.

Araneta's bête noir was Central Bank's Miguel Cuaderno, who had been favorably represented in recent historical work.
Yusuke Takagi portrays him as an effective technocrat, successfully navigating ecnomic decolonization and the foriging of state institutions.
Cuaderno emerges as the disinterested technocrat defending state strength, while his foes (Araneta was the biggest) became agents of the state's weakness.

The nuances within intra-elite debates had immense effects on the development of the Philippine economy—effects, which, naturally, extended beyond the elite.

The Great Debate concerned monetary and fiscal policy, and assessing it require an examination of macroeconomic strategy and its effects.
History of macroeconomic policy, from the New Deal to Japan's developmental state, proves that further factors, other than corruption and rent-seeking, enabled an interventionist state.

# Economic Planning and Economic Literacy in the 1950s
The Philippine Economy in the 1950s was in the process of decolonization.
The US made postwar rehabilitation aid contingent on the signing of the infamous Bell Trade Act which limited Philippine exports to the US, denied the Philippines tariff and currency autonomy, and granted special economic privileges to American investors and traders..
Although modified in 1955, the new treaty maintained parity rights for American businessmen in the Philippines, causing massive trade deficits.
Demand for rehabilitation and consumer goods were high, but there was little to produce either for local consumption or for export.
Importers, ninety percent of whom were American, greatly benefited.
By the end of the decade, export earnings amounted to less than 10 percent of the country's income, which remained almost entirely agricultural.

Manufacturing employed very little of the labor force, and rural productivity was in decline.

The foundation of the Central Bank in 1949 was a symbol of nationalism and modernity rooted in financial independence via the emerging mandarin class.
The Central Bank and the National Economic Council were both possible loci for economic planning.
The NEC could be used to articulate alternative views, but was subjected to congressional interference due to its membership consisting of Congressmen and presidential appointees.

The 1950s was still a relatively high point for economic debates within the bureaucracy.
The dramatic increase of the government's powers due to its implementation of import and exchange controls allowed for the entry of technocrats.

The hostile intensity of the debate was due to the bureaucracy's lack of training in a time when economics profession in the Philippines was in its infancy.
The relevance of economics as a discipline as distinct from lawyers, businessmen, journalists, and other "practical men" was unclear.

# Putting Money to Work
The Great Debate began during Araneta's position in the Quirino government, when he started to critique the deflationary policies of the Central Bank.
During the Magsaysay administration, the debate played out within the government.
Araneta later resigned from the Magsaysay administration due to the rejection of ideas.

Cuaderno remained governor of the Central Bank, and succeeded in maintaining the foreign exchange control policy in the Garcia administration.

Araneta argued for targeted spending to boost agricultural and industrial production; called for a devaluation of the peso; and advocated full employment.

In 1952, Araneta called for a New Deal for the Philippines that would prioritize agricultural production and the creation of a stronger industrial base.
He wanted credit for land resettlement, the construction of road in undeveloped areas, the establishment of heavy industry, and the immediate parceling of landed estates.
He argued that deficit spending would boost economic activity and reduce unemployment.

The advocacy for the devalued peso was premised on a concern that the Philippines was becoming import-dependent.
At a rate of two pesos to one dollar, it was cheap for Filipinos to import from the US.
To limit import, the Central Bank controlled the amount of dollars importers could access to buy foreign goods.

Limiting of dollars was a form of import control was distinct from exchange control.
The first form of control was the currency peg of two pesos to one dollar, which made imports cheaper, increasing incentive to import.
The other form of control limited the dollar supply that importers could access, decreasing their capacity to import.
Both forms of controls existed at the same time.

Araneta consistently sought to aid exporters.
He supported limiting dollars for imports and depreciating the peso, but believed that limiting the dollar was unwieldy in the hands of Miguel Cuaderno.
He criticized the Central Bank for its mismanagement of the allocation of dollars, believing that it should be reserved for industrialists to import raw materials and machinery.
Araneta argued that the government needed to reduce their prices through a devalued peso, allowing Philippine products to compete in the world market.
Since the US would start increasing its duties on Philippine products through the removal of preferential tariffs in 1956, the Philippines needed to make its products cheaper in the American market.
He also argued that overvaluing the peso would amount to a conceal tax on exports and therefore on production and laborers as they would receive more if the peso were cheaper.

For Araneta, economics was a tool for social justice, and national progress was better judged through employment rather than production.
He argued that national production is only a measuring tool to determine if the national output is adequate to provide for the needs of the people, but should not be the main objective.
This was an integral part of his vision of a Christian Democracy in the Philippines; employment was essential to human dignity.

The key ingredient for employment was credit.
Araneta believed that unemployment could be solved through government support.

The Central Bank's deflationary policies created great unemployment in the 1950s.

The three prongs of Araneta's economic policy was geared towards industrialization.
Claro M. Recto was one of Araneta's main allies.
Both Recto and Araneta argued that the US opposed Philippine industrialization to continue their dominance in the Philippine market.
The expensive peso encouraged Filipino businesses to import from America, making it dependent on American industry, while the lack of credit for heavy industry ensured that the Philippines would remain an agricultural economy.

Araneta also became aware of developments in the science of economic planning in Europe and the US.
Araneta argued for a participation in a global modernity that allowed individual and states to realize equal opportunity, which is at the core of democracy.
Araneta contended that industrialization could not be restricted to the elite nations, and that agricultural economies must become the exception rather than the rule.

Comparison with other nations was key to Araneta's nationalist internationlism.

By the 1960s, Aranetas was referencing not only Western Europe but also the emergent developmental state in Japan.
Araneta explained that unlike Japan, Filipinos did not spend their postwar American aid to set up industries, resulting in feeble industries.

# Inflation Rhetoric and a False Economic Populism
The result of Miguel Cuaderno's proposals were inflation.
Cuaderno gained support for his proposals due to massive price increases from mismanagement of the Philippines National Bank in the 1920s, and the overprinting of currency during the Japanese occupation.
Politicians during the election cycle feared criticism caused by inflation.

Cuaderno's arguments featured a disdain for deficit financing, sensitivity to the size of the money supply, and the notion of "responsible spending"—equating the economy to a household.
Cuaderno also argued that government financing was a luxury of the developed world, and poor countries needed austerity.

Cuaderno argued that Araneta's proposals would drive up the cost of products, and increase the cost of imports, creating further inflation.
Advocates of austerity posed as responsible managers that prevented irresponsible spending.
This position had a negative impact on the country's foreign reserves.
A boost in production of rice and corn through devaluation would have saved foreign exchange, as it would require less imports.
Increase in the production of agricultural exports like sugar and coconuts would have earned the country more foreign exchange.

Araneta argued about the need to support agriculture and industry, but was not taken seriously for his ties with "the sugar bloc."
Moreover, it was difficulty to argue for "weakness" when advocates for austerity projected national pride onto the strength of the currency.

Cuadero supported import controls and tariffs, but opposed devaluation.

Keynes argued that inflation was bad for investors whose investments will decline, while deflation is bad for labor because it leads enterprises to reduce production in anticipation of declines in future profit.
Deflation was deemed more dangerous by Kaynes.
Keynes also saw inflation as an indirect method of taxation for cash-strapped governments.
The trade off of inflation for the government would be to spend more funds to finance itself, but consumer would pay more for goods in the market.
Although too much inflation would freeze consumption, it should not prevent governments to use it as a policy tool.

Keynesian economics advocated for specific solutions to specific problems.
Weighing the possible effects of inflationary policy was the task for economic managers, not something left to chance.
This flexible style of economics was unheard of in the Central Bank where austerity reigned.
The inflexibility of the Central Bank stemmed from Cuaderno's personality and its bureaucratic consistency which made the bank institutionally stable.
Although the Central Bank is insulated from political fights, it is also unresponsive to changing circumstance, and the NEC could not serve as an alternative as it was rendered ineffective by presidential and congressional appointments.

Without an alternative, it was easy to pass off economic populism as sound policy given electoral pressures.
Challenging austerity forces one to argue from a counter-intuitive position.
Common sense says that it is bad for prices of commodities to rise, good to have a strong currency, and that cash-strapped economies should spend "responsibly," so it is easier to argue for austerity.

Enjoying this populism, Cuaderno engaged in economic fear-mongering.
He claimed that a weak currency threatened the peace and order of the country.

Cuaderno dismissed Keynesianism as a Western trend inapplicable to developing countries.
He argued that, unlike the Philippines, the US had a reservoir of unemployed or idle resources that are activated by Government deficit spending, thus harnessing back production.
The New Deal was judged based on its effects on inflation.

Cuaderno's arguments were facile.
Although the New Deal was inflationary, inflation incentivized consumers to spend their way out of the Depression.
Moreover, deflationary economics have shown to stall the progress of the New Deal.
Also, the Keynesian policy does not forbid government financing intended to boost production, and Araneta's plans included the mobilization of resources to promote production, particularly in agriculture.
Inflation can also serve as a form of taxation that allows the government to invest in productive capacity.

The treat of overblown inflation and great deficits were ruses.
According to Golay, Philippine domestic prices have decline through much of the postwar period.
The first 8 years of Cuaderno's term saw a net deflation.
Deficit financing had also been modest and matched by foreign exchange receipts, meaning the cumulative deficit had been small compared to relevant economic factors.
Inflation would also not have a massive effect on the poorest of the poor as they consumed very little of import-dependent products.
Although inflation would effect urban workers in the short-term, a devalued currency would provide incentives for increased domestic supply of essential goods in the long-term.
There was plenty of room for less austerity.

Araneta failed to articulate a systematic defense of moderate inflation, and a critique of deflation.
Araneta accepted the terms of Cuarderno's argument.

Araneta never explained how inflation can be a legitimate and effective macroeconomic option given certain circumstances.
Araneta regularly contended that his proposals would achieve deflation in the long term.
He claimed that money expended for development is inflationary only while the development has not reached the production stage, when it will turn deflationary.

The assumption of Araneta's response and Cuaderno's critique of the New Deal premised on "capacity utilization," which says that economies can expand without an increase in inflation if labor and capital are underutilized.
According to the theory, a boost in production increases the amount of available goods, which reduces prices.
However, the New Deal has shown that productive capacities still led to inflation.
Recent analysis has proven that capacity utilization cannot be proven empirically.
Araneta should have attempted to complete his Keynesian view of the economy, but was restricted by the ideology of austerity.

Critically, in accepting the mitigation of inflation as a long-term goal, Araneta did not mention the threats of continually reduced prices: increase in the cost of debt, reduced incentive to produce, and reduction in the amount of money firms had for wages.
Unemployment in the Philippines necessitated inflation.

At the time, Keynesian theory had yet to adopt the full arsenal of theories to defend inflationary monetary policy.

# The Vindication: Philips in the Philippines
In his 1984 address to the Philippines, Gerardo P. Sicat, former Minister of Economic Planning and then Director-General of the National Economic and Development Authority, reflected on the failed postwar industrial policy.
Industrialization was supported by an overpriced peso, which made firms dependent on imported raw materials.
As imported raw materials became too expensive or got cut off, industries failed.

Since the peso was stable relative  to the dollar, industries borrowed foreign technology, imported raw materials and capital goods mainly from the US, and produced imitations of American goods.

The Philips Curve has shown to be consistent from the 1950s until 2012.

Comparing inflation between 1956-1970, 1970-1985, and 1985-2012, it moves from extremely low inflation, to high inflation during the Marcos period, to a stable inflation, respectively.
The Cuaderno era and its aftermath looks like a period of austerity fundamentalism.

The implications of austerity was obvious.
From 1951-1955, the average GDP growth was 8.078, and dropped to 4.8 from 1956-1960, which saw a partial recovery in the 1970s.
Immediate postwar Philippines was bent on maintaining a particular exchange rate, even at the cost of growth.

These were the same conclusions Araneta drew in the 1950s.
He complained about the scarcity of foreign reserves caused by a dependence on imports, lamented the autocratic nature of currency policy that hampered the growth of an export industry, and decried the inability of deflationary policy to create jobs.

Fredinand Marcos, who exiled Araneta, implement Araneta's vision.
This lead to the cultivation of an industrial base that was no longer dependent on American imports.

The first years of the Marcos period showed a genuine attempt at export-oriented industrialization.
Despite a global recession in developing countries, the country saw positive economic growth, and low the export of low-wage manufactures saw solid gains.
This growth was hindered by plunging global commodity prices and increased protectionism in the US and other countries in the late 1970s.

Developmentalism in the Philippines was not doomed to fail.

Araneta grave credit to Marcos's economic policies, but mentions that they could have been implemented by Magsaysay had his proposals not have been opposed by Cuaderno and the American embassy.
Marcos's policies does not justify his continuance in power as a dictator.

# Conclusion
Araneta's ideas would still be unpopular and incomprehensible today.

The science of Keynesian macroeconomics involves trade-offs and the negotiation of grey areas.

Although Keynesian economics had mainstreamed in the 1950s through the Bretton Woods institutions, these ideas remained alien to Filipino policymakers.

At the time, the IMF supported the ideas of Araneta, allowing Cuaderno to dismiss his ideas as promoting "foreign ideas."
Neoimperialism is an inadequate lens to make sense of the failed Philippine industrial state.
Although American import interests preferred an expensive peso, the Bretton Woods institutions promoted a notion of economic modernity that privileged autonomous, industrial, and planned economies.
There was no homogeneous imperialism, but a global contestation of ideas in which the Philippines took part.

The common view of Philippine underdevelopment, that of corrupt, rent-seeking caciques rigging the political system, is not entirely true.
Although these are real phenomena that have harmed the state, they are not necessarily death sentences for a decolonizing nation.
Corrupt states are not immune to popular ideas.

Economic planning revived liberal democracy in the West.
It combined socialism with liberalism, creating forms of socialism compatible to liberal democratic politics: social democracy and Christian democracy.
These movements believed that a more equitable society can be achieved without overthrowing the state.

These new forms of liberal economics did not take root in the Philippines.
The consistent failure of economic planning ensure that fundamental critiques of the policies remained the norm for leftwing activists, diminishing liberalism's message of moderation.
The greatest failure of mid-century Philippine liberalism was its inability to propose solutions to manage class differences.

The grammar of the Philippine Left has remained predominantly Marxist.
The boldness of Marxist theory turned it into the default discourse of anti-colonial progressives.
