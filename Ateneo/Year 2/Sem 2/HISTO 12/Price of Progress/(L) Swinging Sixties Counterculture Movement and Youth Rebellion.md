# Ecumenism
To erase the boundaries between Christian Churches and form a unified Christian perspective
Second Vatican Council (Vatican II)
World Council of Churches

Question among churches regarding their role in contemporary society: to evangelize, or transform social injustice
Emphasized their role is also to address social injustices

Emergence of Liberation Theology: a social and political movement within Christian churches and denominations that attempts to interpret the gospel of Jesus Christ through the lived experiences of oppressed people
Emerged first in South America (Argentina); preferential treatment of the poor; Christ associated himself with the poor
The Church should use its power in order to help the poor
Signaled the idea of a synthesis of Marxist theory (typically opposite of Christianity), a theory of that emphasizes the ideas of class, with the teachings of Christianity.

Many priests and pastors were assigned to marginalized communities, and realized that evangelization is not enough and had no power to stop the violence of warlords and bandits.
Creation of religious groups that embraced liberation theology: National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP), United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP), Christians for National Liberation (CNL)
Theology of Struggle: liberation theology in the Philippines

# Muslim Independence Movement
After Philippine independence, several Muslims who demanded that Mindanao should be a separate country because they had a different set of culture

A secessionist organization aimed at ending Filipino internal colonialism in Mindanao by establishing an independent Muslim nation-state that will encompass the whole island
Filipinos are seen as colonizers
Became radical in the 60s after the Jabidah massacre

Later changed its name to Mindanao Independence Movement to assure Christians in Mindanao that they will not be treated as second class citizens
Magsaysay implement an agrarian reform program where land would be redistributed to landless farmers. However, they did not distribute the land owned by hacienderos but relocated landless farmers from Central Luzon to Mindanao, leading to conflicts among Muslim and Lumad groups
Many ancestral lands owned by Moros and Lumad were distributed to farmer immigrants
Conflicts between Christian and Muslims/Lumad
Moros and Christian groups created military units, leading to several massacres

During the Spanish colonial period, interaction with Spanish Manila was very limited.
The identity of sultanates of Sulu are more regional than national, meaning, their interaction is focused on their SEA neighbors rather than Spanish Manila

During the American colonial period, Mindanao was perceived as a separated entity from the Philippines
Americans tried to reincorporate Mindanao into the Philippine national-state

Muslim leaders, like Datu Piang, whose politics focused on SEA, had to reorient their politics to the national politics in Manila
Hadji Butu, decendant of Piang, in the 1930s, perceived himself in national terms, instead of regional
Americans considered non-Hispanized Filipinos, like the Moros, to be completely different from Hispanized Filipinos, and some argued that areas with a majority Moro population could be considered a separate state
Most of the American colonial period, Mindanao was governed by a military officer rather than a civilian; military rule rather than civilian government like the rest of the Philippines

When agrarian reforms started to be implemented, conflicts were only heightened, as politics might be tilted, along with Moros losing their land
Rivalries also existed within ethnic groups
Local warlords could not be controlled

A possible resolution for conflicts that was seen was treating Mindanao as a separate autonomous entity
Datu Udtug Matalam was a leader of the independence movement

# Counterculture Movement
An anti-establishment movement that developed in the 60s
Baby boomers challenged the pre-existing norms and beliefs of the parents
It created different subcultures that challenged the rushing tide of authoritarianism around the world

Idea of love, the state supporting the education system, etc, became popular to the youth
Due to increase of educational opportunities
College students challenged the prevailing norms through culture, and activism

Emergence of rockers in Britain, signifying a shift in masculinity
Emergence ideas of free love regarding romance and sexuality in the US
Kawaii culture in Japan as opposed to the sense of masculinity

Shift in music
The Beatles, The Monkeeys, and Elvis Presley represented rebellion against ideas of sexuality, gender, and political authority

## Sexual revolution
A movement that challenged the traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality, interpersonal relation and gender identity
Sex shifted from a private thing to a public thing; from a source of shame to something that should be celebrated
Emergence of more sexualized art forms
Pursued ideas of gender spectrum

In Philippines, cinema shifted from clean cut antagonists to rebels and sexually charged women
Film of Asion Salonga, presented a robin-like figure
Maton as protagonist: kind hearted by does not follow rules
Bomba films

## Kabataang Makabayan
Rooted in different teach-ins of review groups in colleges before Martial Law
Education increased and new universities established after independence
In review groups, concerns were discovered about tuition fees, employment after graduation, etc
These teach-ins became more powerful and expanded in scope, becoming student unions
The students unions joined to become the Kabataan Makabayan

First Quarter Storm protest at SONA
1967-1969 saw economic problems, Marcos started an infrastructure program but a debt crisis
1970, Marcos was reelected, and the Philippine faced rapid inflation, an economic downturn from the debt crisis
INF forced the Marcos administration to change its debt payment
Tuition and goods prices were high
Corruption issue, and affair scandal of Marcos, so his popularity was declining

SONA of January 1970, Marcos was expected to be welcomed outside the legislative building, but were actually protesters, throwing rocks at him and his wife
Protest ended in March/April because the school year was done
Students were not attending classes but were protesting
Presence of killings: Battle of Mendiola

UP Commune: UP students who were not allowed to protest in Mendiola decided to protest in UP instead
Rumors of Philippine Constabulary Metropolitan Command were sending police inside UP to arrest students, so students barricaded the gates of UP and declared UP to be a separate entity from the Philippines 
Eventually the police arrested the students

## Intelligentsia
Many students who graduated entered the official intelligentsia
Responded differently from the events that happened in the First Quarter Storm and the UP Commune
Radical academics: revolt against the state is the only solution; Nur Misuari established of the Moro National Liberation Front; Jose Maria Sison who founded the Communist Party of the Philippines
Technocrats: problems are a product of elite democracy, reform society through reengaging elites towards development, not necessarily against elite democracy, collaborated with Marcos to influence politics; Cesar Virata
Civil society: students became engaged in advocacy politics, was in infancy, weakened by Martial Law as members decided to emigrate outside the Philippines
