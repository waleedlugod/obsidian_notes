----
Oct 1944, Second Philippine Republic celebrated their first anniversary.
America returned to the Philippines in the same month.

Japanese propaganda presented America as a conqueror.
Laurel declared a state a war, but never declared war against the US.

On October 17, 1944, the US began its reinvasion of the Philippines via Leyte.
December 13: Amerian forces invaded Mindoro.
December 15: US army began reinvasion of Luzon
February 13, 1945: American troops recaptured Bataan and Clark airfield.
February 3 - March 3: Battle of Manila.

The commanding officer of the Japanese forces ordered to retreat Manila and go to Baguio, but several officers refused officers and resisted the American forces.
This resulted in the battle that destroyed Manila, also known as the "Rape of Manila."
Most prewar structures in Manila were destroyed, except the post office.

April 26: Baguio City is recaptured.
September 2: Japan officially surrendered to US.


The war traumatized Filipinos and left the Philippines in ruins.
Major questions:
1. What will happen to collaborators?
2. Will the government recognize the contributions of the Hukbalahap Guerillas?
3. How will the government address the economic concerns of the populace.

Hukbalahap Guerillas are seen as a threat to the Commonwealth government and ruling elites.
Elites are from haciendero clans while Hukbalahap are from the masses, rooted from peasant unions from the 1930s.
Peasants can realistically right the hacienderos due to their war experience.

Hyprinflation due to the war.
Talks of economic reconstruction began, but the main concern for the masses is survival.

# What will happen to collaborators?
War criminals were tried in Manila.
Although Tomoyuki Yamashita ordered officers to retreat from Manila, they stayed and committed war crimes.
Due to this, Yamashita was held responsible and was found guilty for war crimes on the grounds of commander responsibility.
Yamashita was ordered to be executed, but killed himself before it was done.

Many members of the Kalibapi were part of the Quezon administration.
Their goal was not to help the Japanese, but reduce their impact on the daily lives of the Filipinos.

With the death of Quezon, Osmena became the new president.
MacArthur did not believe Osmena was not the right person to lead the Philippines to independence.
MacArthur preferred Roxas, who was a collaborator.

Main candidates for the 1946 presidential elections were Osmena and Roxas.
MacArthur pressured Osmena to release an amnesty to pardon all collaborators.
Some did not accept the amnesty and fought for their innocence such as Laurel, Benigno Aquino Sr., and Recto, who all won.

Nacionalista split into the Osmena-wing (Nacionalista) and Roxas-wing (Liberal) parties.
Nacionalista dominance ended.
Nacionalista and Liberal parties were dominant from 1946 - 1972.

MacArthur spread lies to increase mass appeal to Roxas, who later won the presidency.

# Will the government recognize the contributions of the Hukbalahap Guerillas?
Near the end of the war, the Huks helped USAFEE fight the Japanese.
Before that, the Huks tried to form an alliance with the Makapili, who were both primarily peasantry.
Huks offered an alliance where they would end the Japanese occupation and resist the return of the Americans.

Japanese learned of the potential alliance, and killed members of the Makapili negotiating with the Huks.
The Huks later then supported the Americans.

After liberating several towns in Central Luzon, the Huks were disarmed by the Americans and USAFEE.
Many Huks were arrested charged with war crimes by the government after WWII, angering the peasantry.
Collaborators were given amnesty, but Huks, who resisted the Japanese, were arrested.

Many Huks were encouraged to take up arms against the government.
The Huks renamed themselves to Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan.
Some Huks formed alliances with the Osmena-wing, others ran for office, some won seats in Congress.
The Huks were later blocked from sitting in Congress, further radicalizing peasants.
Huks decided a possibility to rebel against the government.

# How will the government address the economic concerns of the populace?
The war radically weakened the Philippine state.
The central government in Manila could no longer control the countryside.
Rural and urban areas saw a radical transformation.

Due to the violence in the province and poverty, many migrated to cities like Manila and Cebu.
Cities could not longer handle the influx of population, causing the emergence of slums.
Elite and middle class started to leave urban centers, and live in subdivisions patterned after the US like Quezon City, San Juan, and Makati.

## Violence
A state is composed of the government, territory, population, and sovereignty.
According to Max Weber, the primary function of the state is to monopolize violence.
The state controls resources and power via violence.
Violence is physical, structural, or symbolic.
Violence is not necessarily negative, but a projection of power.
Other institutions cannot compete with the state with the regards to violence.

Physical: use of force through the state's security apparatus (military and police)
Structural: control over access to resources through selective recognition of rights and privileges (suffrage).
Symbolic: control over images and stereotypes that will provide rationalization and justification to the use of physical and structural violence; who is the "enemy of the state" that warrants the use of physical and structural violence (calling Filipino patriots as bandits)

strong state: successfully monopolize the legitimate use of violence; accompanied by weak society: other institutions cannot compete with the state
weak: fail to monopolize the legitimate use of violence, and compensate by franchising violence to other institutions; warlords are convinced to be part of the government; accompanied by strong society: other institutions compete with the state for control
failed state: fail to control the use of violence; presence of other institutions with their own security apparatus, etc. such as warlords

## Franchising violence
Emerged warlords have their own military.
The state legitimized the warlords by giving the brand name of the government, in exchange for being loyal to the government.
Many warlords entered politics by becoming mayors, and senators.

Due to the high price of goods, masses engaged in the black market.
Gang leaders (maton) who controlled the black market were cultivated into Robinhood-like figures such as Nicasio "Asiong" Salonga.

Warlords in the provinces emerged.
Some were a product of the Japanese occupation, others were from the principalia such as Ramon Durano in Danao, Cebu.
Danao's major export until the 1990s were illegal guns.
Durano is the grandfather of Rodrigo Duterte.
Other warlordic clans were Dimaporos of Lanao, and Marcos of Ilocos.
