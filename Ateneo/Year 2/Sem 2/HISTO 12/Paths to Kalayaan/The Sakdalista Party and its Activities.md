At the end of September 1933, Sakdalistas assembled in Luneta Park to welcome Ramos home. Ramos declared that the Sakdalistas should establish a political party which called for immediate, absolute, and complete independence.
On 29 October 1933, the Sakdalista Party was formally proclaimed.
The Democrata Party was losing influence as an opposition party while the Nacionalista Party was split in to Pro and Anti factions.
The Supreme Court having declared the Communist party illegal, the Sakdalista served as a radical opposition party in the coming election.

# The Sakdalista Party (Lapiang Sakdalista)
## Establishment of the Party
The Sakdalista Party announced its platform in the Pamahayag at Patakaran ng Lapiang Sakdalista publication.
Initially, the movement aimed to expose prevailing corruption and the truth (katotohanan) as well as facilitate the understanding of the reasons (katuwiran) for independence.
The Sakdalista leadesr realized no politician has worked for Philippine independence soely under the terms set by the Jones Law ([[(L) American Collaborators and Early Political Parties in the Philippines]]), and called the incumbent politicians the "new Federalists."

## Party Emblem
L. x B. A.-S. F. = Lapian ng Bayan Api, Sangkapuluang Filipinas.
star = guiding light that led the three Magi Kings to the newborn Jesus; the party will lead towards a free Philippines.
rays = light from heaven; heroes of the 1896 Revolution; katotohanan.
right hand = struggle for the motherland.
heart = love and devotion to help oppressed countrymen; brotherhood
Sacred: Christianity and the spirits of the heroes of the 1896 Revolution.

The party, in the Pamahayag, quoted various figures such as Jesus, Bonifacio, and Rizal.

## Party Platform
The party declared it would fight within the law for immediate and complete independence. America was not an enemy.
They called for the unity for all Filipinos.
They wished to established a government that is wholly Filipinos in its origins and objectives.

They began by addressing the corruption of politicians who exploited the poor for their wealth. The politicians would also hinder the "good aims" of the US emphasizing the Japanese threat and falsely predicting higher taxes following the departure of the US from the islands.

Corrupt politicians would also utilize public institutions to indoctrinate the Filipino youth.
The elections which gave them power were corrupt, the laws they passed favored the rich and enforced by the police and judicial system.
The Sakdalista Party charged politicians with adopting foreign customs that did not fit traditional customs.
The people's money were being wasted, with culprits escaping punishment while those who could not pay taxes were persecuted. Therefore, people were burdened by high taxes, and children were suffering from undernourishment.
Traditional livelihood displaced by imported items.

Corrupt politicians created division based on language, social class, and organizational affiliation.
Constables were sent to Moroland to fight Muslims, creating deep resentment.

Politicians readily aided the rich.
The constabulary, sanitary department, police, and other institutions became enemies of the peasants as they neglected to serve them.
The greatness of schools, courts, and civil service has been destroyed.
Politicians believed their power was secure with the US in the Philippines.

The Sakdalistas proposed 35 objectives, organized into 9 sections:
1. Government and Its Officials and Employees;
2. Industry and Commerce;
3. Justice;
4. Land and Tenancy Arrangements;
5. Labor Issues;
6. Education, Culture, and Religion;
7. Defense and Military;
8. Social Welfare;
9. Taxation.

The first section was the longest, indicating their deep resentment of incumbent politicians.
The party also gave detailed instructions on how loans should be handled given the high occurrence of usury faced by rural folks.
They also believed land has been unjustly taken away from frairs and hacienda owners, who manipulated the law in their favor; therefore land should be returned to their rightful owners. They proposed that landlords once again show a paternalistic attitude towards tenants.

Under the Sakdalistas' administration, the Philippines is proposed to have a strong military force.
Instead of the cedula tax and taxes on land and agriculture, new taxes would be imposed on guns which everyone would be free to own.
Filipinos would have their own factories for producing weapons and ammunition.
They would also manufacture their own goods instead of depending on imports, and generate exports. Luxury items would also be manufactured locally, and money spent would go to Filipinos instead of foreigners.
They envisioned a wholly Filipino society where Filipino culture would flourish.
The educated would use their talents for the good of the country instead of personal gain.
The poor would own land and have fair access to credit.
They wished to establish a society where people can live dignified lives.
As a result, patriotism and brotherly love would increase.

They party firmly believed in the ability of the Filipino people to govern themselves.
They declared they would obtain independence by 1935, and resign if not achieved.

The Pamahayag emphasized that only the teachings of Rizal, del Pilar, and Lopez Jaena could lead to independence.

## Organizational Structure
Elected officers:
Atty. Felino Cajucom - president;
Simeon de Sena - secretary;
Benigno Ramos - sugo ng Bayang Api;
Ramon Crespo - Ramos's private secretary.

Many representatives of the initial congress meetings were urban intellectuals who were native to their provinces.

The party was to be headed by a National Committee composed of the presidents of the Provincial Committees.
The Provincial Committee would consist of the heads of the Municipal Committees within the province.
Under the Municipal Committees were the Barrio committees, each with 12 members.

Party chapters were quickly established following the "Sacred Enlistment".

# The Election of 1934
## The Election Results
The Sakdalista Party campaigned for the June 1934 elections.
They emphasized that their movement was law-abiding, and the election was an effective weapon to achieve independence.
They stressed that each member should disseminate the following to potential voters:
1. Voting for the old politicians, regardless of political affiliation, would only lead to the continuation of suffering, especially taxes;
2. Votes should not be give to pay debts of gratitude;
3. Spread the influence of the Sakdalista by selling more Sakdal papers.
They were also encouraged to repeat phrases that call upon nationalist figures suchas Benigno Ramos.

The Sakdalista Party announced itself to the international community via a cablegram to Pres. Roosevelt in January 1934, declaring that the Jones Act could not be exchanged for anything other than independence.

In the June election, the party had a noteworthy presence.
In Quezon's home province in Tayabas, Sakdalista candidate Antonio Argosino lost 800 votes behind the winning candidate.
In Atimonan, Jose T. Timog garnered more votes than Quezon.

In Laguna, Aurelio Almazan and Mariano Untivero were elected to the House.
In the Senate race, Celerino Tiongco pulled more vote than Rafael Palma, former UP president, but could not overcome the Cemocrata leader Juan Sumulong.
In Santa Rosa, majority of municipal councilors were Sakdalista Party members.
In Nagcarlan, eight out o hte ten new members of the Municipal Council were from the party, including president and vice president.
Most of those elected from the party had little formal schooling beyond the primary grades.

Many of the Sakdalista Party supporters could not vote because they did not meet the literacy qualifications for voter registration.
In Barrio Baliti of San Fernando, Pampanga, 90 percent of residents were illiterate.

## Reactions to the Sakdalista Showing
Gov. Gen. Frank Murphy welcomed the Sakdalista Party's victory as the emergence of a true opposition party. He expressed concern that they might become dangerous because of its support from peasants and laborers.
Most journalists did not understand the party's positions. Some called the representatives from Laguna semi-communists due to the party policy of not paying taxes tothe government.
The Tribune called them essentially communistic left-wing, and said it would be the first time to have an extremely radical faction in the government. They also said that the election of the Sakdalista members proved that the masses could not always be forced to do as told, refusing to stay forgotten by using the ballot. The paper congratulated the party on its victories, taking it as an awakening of the political consciousness of the masses.

The party also had the ability to elect relatively inexperienced candidates.
Newly elected Aurelio Almazan and Mariano Untivero spent nothing on their election campaigns, unlike their opponents.

Some analysts of the time attributed the economic depression of the coconut industry due to government negligence a factor to the party's success.
By 1930, coconut exports had fallen by nearly 30 percent, leading to a drop in employment.
Raw copra exports had fallen by 60 percent, and there was almost no American demand for copra.

In the cities, the depression brought layoffs of workers engaged in export.
Smaller commercial establishments also declared bankruptcy, especially textile businesses who were in competition against imported Japanese textiles and faced the reduced purchasing power of the citizens due to heavy unemployment.
In Manila, people voted for traditional labor or radical leaders such as Francisco Varona of the "Pros" and Alfonso Mendoza of the "Antis" who both garnered 11,000 votes while the Sakdalista Party candidate Antonio Velisario garnered 500.
Although the labor movement was strong in Manila, the party did not attract city labors, most of whom were members of labor unions.
Many of those suffering from economic depression were illiterate and had no franchise.
An editor of The Sunday Tribune reported that the party were supported by small landowners, industrialists, shopkeepers, and urban professionals were not necessarily in dire economic situations.

Those who voted for the party did so for a corruption-free administration that pursued independence. However, this independence implied different things to different voters.
Independence would alleviate distressing social and economic conditions; and bring dignity to Filipinos to enjoy their own culture.

Despite the success of the Sakdalista Party, Quezon still won the overwhelming vote.
Due to the passage of the Tydings-McDuffie Act ([[(L) Independence Missions and the 1935 Philippine Elections]]), Quezon's "Antis" occupied a majority of the Lower Houses.
Now a major player of national politics, the party wanted to reposition itself and sever its ties to the "subversive secret organization" of the disbanded Tanggulan Society whom their power originated.
They also wanted to disassociate themselves from the outlawed Communist Party who they allied themselves with for a time.
They declared they were neither pro-Communist nor pro-Tanggulan Society, and wanted to present their activities as lawful.

# Post-Election Activities
The party organized rallies to celebrate their election victory.

In these rallies, people expressed their protest of the Tydings-McDuffie Act.
The Sakdalistas expressed that the Tydings-McDuffie Act was a step towards a love of wealth, and feared the act would destroy hope for the country's independence.
The celebration rallies turned into anti-T-M campaigns.

There was disagreement on how the party would achieve their objectives.
Speakers advocated for nonviolence, and to live according to the philosophy of Rizal, selfless and dedicated to social, economic, and political justice for the people.
They proclaimed that independence should be obtained through diplomacy, boycott, and bloodless revolution.
Some speakers advocated for less peaceful methods. Some argued that if independence could not be won through good ideas, force may be necessary.
Party branches continued to expand into other regions including Mindanao.

Moral guidelines were emphasized to strengthen the party's unity.
Children were expected to respect their parents; men were expected to respect women; young girls were expected to be modest; everyone was expected to keep traditional Filipino customs.
Members were asked to show reverence to each other, and give sympathetic aid to fellow countrymen.

Untivero and Almazan, new delegates to the legislature, planned to present 17 bills  basd on the reforms based on the party platform.
They proposed an independence bill based on the promises made in the Jones Law; rejection of the Tydings-McDuffie Act; abolition of cedula tax; investigation into ownership of all friar lands; promotion of native industries and reduction of dependence on imports; development of a national military force; establishment of factories to manufacture arms; and teachings of native dialects in all public schools and the use of these dialects in the Courts of First Instance.

These proposals were not well received, especially since Alamazan advocated for a salary reduction for lawmakers.
Other legislatures petitioned to oust Sakdalistas.

## Activities in the Provinces
Sakdalista committees that sprang up in the central and southern Luzon provinces were autonomous.
Some organized the local youth and provided information about earning a livelihood.
They urged the youth to be politically active.
Some members created their own ten basic principles to live honorably, how to work together, and how to protect Philippine traditions.

## Ramos's Travel to Japan
In November 1934, Ramos announced he was going to pressure Congress to reconsider the Tydings-McDuffie Act and to lobby for the fulfillment of the Jones Law.
Soon after arriving in Japan, Ramos announced he would be staying in Japan indefinitely.

Ramos intended to publish a newspaper to inform the international community of hte Sakdalista ideology, and gain military assistance from Japan.
This contradicted the party's ideology of independence through peaceful means.

Ramos was introduced to Kumpei Matsumoto by his interpreter Tomoji Kageyama.
Matsumoto was the head of Ajia Seinen Kyodan which advocated for Asian unity, and an ultranationalist who had close contact to other extermists.
Romas was further introduced to other ultranationalists who gave sympathy with his goal of independence and paid for his expenses in Tokyo.

Uzuhiko Ashizo wrote a supportive article of Ramos.
He considered Ramos a comrade in liberating Asia from western imperialism.
He objected to Japanese military adventurism, such as the Manchuria occupation, as it was the same path taken by Western imperialism.
He warned Ramos against seeking aid from the Japanese government or military which had hidden imperialist motives.
He suggested to approach nongovernment private supporters.

## Campaign for Anti-Tydings-McDuffie Act
After the June election, Quezon's "Antis" and Osmenña's "Pros" slowly regrouped to challenge the Commonwealth through unity.
The Sakdalistas criticized this moved as it reinforced Quezon's political influence.

When the Tydings-McDuffie Act was accepted in May 1934, a committee was requested to form to determine imperfections in the independence law. This was done in order to secure revisions of the trade provisions.
Five American senators were appointed to the Committee of the Congressional Mission.

Party representatives decided to produce a pamphlet entitled Memorial, an appeal for immediate, absolute, and complete independence.
They attempted to give a copy to the US President, and members of Cabinet and Congress.
1000 copies were distributed to all foreign consuls in Manila.

Tydings declared to the Philippine Constitutional Convention in December that the Filipinos were not ready for independence as they were still economically dependent.
A plebiscite confirming the Tydings-McDuffie Act and the Commonwealth was scheduled for 14 May 1935.

The party planned the a campaign against the act via the following steps:
1. The barrio-level committees should meet every weekend to propagate Sakdalista principles;
2. The leadership should give lectures once a month to train members how to explain the Sakdalistas' stance on independence;
3. Each Sakdalista should recruit others into the movement.

Sakdalistas began accepting invitations to public debates.
In San Pablo, Laguna, five to two were in favor of the Sakdalista orator.
Others were held in Santa Rosa, Laguna, attended by three thousand people, and Intramuros, Manila, near the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, attended by six thousand.

## Renewed Determination of the Sakdalistas
Despite Ramos's absence, the Sakdalista leadership attempted to build a unified movement.

The Sakdalistas viewed themselves as heirs to the heritage of Rizal and other revolutionary heroes.

The party continued to hold ceremonies.
Those of importance was Rizal Day on 19 June and the anniversary of Rizal's death on 30 December.

## Movements within the Movement
The party began showing signs of divergence within the movement, with some members involved in secret societies and revolutionary plots.

The motives of these secret movements was to establish a Republica Filipina.
The party leadership disowned these groups as they were seen as dangerous to the party since they collected money from the poor to purchase arms.

Leadership were concerned members might conduct a Ricartista revolution in the name of the party.
Rumors circulated of Gen. Artemio Ricarte arranging arms in Japan which would be delivered to the Philippines.
When an unverified report of Ricarte returning to the Philippines to lead an uprising was received, the party denied involvement to any uprising.

Those who supported the uprising originated from Ricarte-inspired societies before the party.
Harassment against the party due to their campaign against the Tydings-McDuffie Act by authorities further justified an armed uprising.
Tension between the party and government authorities grew.

## Harassment of the Sakdalista Party
In 1935, the Sakdal weekly dropped in circulation.
A factor of this was Quezon's anti-Sakdalista propaganda.

Quezon accused Ramos of smearing his reputation out of bitterness over his dismissal in 1930; squandering donated money; and not having utnag na loob towards Quezon who arranged his job in the government.
Ramos replied that his value of service to the country war greater than the paychecks received by Quezon, and that money came from the people's taxes. He also charged that Quezon lacked utang na loob for failing to show gratitude to Osmeña for making him a name in politics. The Sakdalistas declared that all money received was announced in the Sakdal and used solely for Sakdalista activities. Ramos argued that government missions were pleasure trips. Ramos also delivered an open letter calling Quezon an enemy of independence.

Quezon ordered the Philippine Constabulary to monitor Sakdalista activities.

The party was criticized as utopian promises.

In the Assembly, the two Sakdalista representatives were removed from their position, three months after their nomination.

Sakdalistas were targeted at the provincial level.
Lawmakers and the administration attempted to block the legal political avenues available to the Sakdalista.

Authorities refused to issue meeting permits.
When a special meeting was held at a private residence in Manila, American policemen asked for a permit, and returned with more police when told a permit was not needed.

In the Sakdal, the party hinted that violent means may be employed if other avenues are closed off.

## The Filipino Freedom—The New Organ
The Sakdal weekly had been placed in a mailing ban.
Another weeekly newspaper was initiated, The Filipino Freedom: Ang Tinig ng Bayang Api.
The paper had a picture of the rising sun with the word "kasarinlan" written across the ten rays. The three mountains represented Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

## Mounting Tensions
Upon Quezon's request, House Speaker Quintin Paredes toured nearby provinces.
His arrival at Gapan, Nueva Ecija, was met with a protest by Sakdalistas.

The government campaign in favor for the Commonwealth showed some success.
Antonio Argosino defected to the Nacionalista camp.

In a new campaign against discontented elements, provincial executives were asked to redouble their efforts against revolutionary rhetoric.

Sec. of Agriculture Eulogio Rodriguez urged radicals to be arrested, and urged the Department of Labor to track radical movement.

# The People's Image of the Sakdalistas
The party was seen was uncompromising.
The word "Sakdalista" was used to describe someone incorruptible.

# Calls for Patience, Calls for Revolt
In the midst of increasing tensions, Sakdalista leaders urged their followers to be patient.
They made an analogy to Christ's suffering, and recalled the lives of Rizal and del Pilar.

Some members were discontent with peaceful means and argued for an armed struggle.

Party Presdient Celerino Tiongco implored members to boycott the referendum, emphasizing that a Commonwealth would deny independence and bring slavery.

In Tayabas, seven Sakdalistas were arrested for plotting a conspiracy against the government and the life of Quezon.
Allegedly, they would enlist an army to revolt on 15 December 1935 under the leadership of Ciriaco Campomanes, the Tayabes regional representative.
Once Quezon died, the party would govern the nation, and sodlers would be given salaries from confiscated government funds.
Most of those arrested were former Tanggulan members who identified as Sakdalista to avoid harassment.

Other Sakdalistas in Tayabas sought nonviolent means and sent a letter to Gov. Gen. Hayden, complaining that members in their province were threatened with prosecution for sedition. They requested that Hayden protect their rights to freely express their opinions and ideas, hold public meetings, and denounce corruption in the government.

According to Hayden, he received similar complaints previously. However, it was up to local authorities to determine a proper course of action.

On 29 April 1935, the Intelligence Division of the constabulary received reports of an Sakdalista uprising, and more should it fail, later supported by arms from Ramos.
On 2 May, another report was received detailing uprisings to be help that night in Manila, Rizal, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, and Tayabas.
