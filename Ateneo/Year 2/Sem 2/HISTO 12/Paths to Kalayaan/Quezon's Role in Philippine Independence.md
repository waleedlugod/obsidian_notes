Joseph F. Hutchinson, Jr.

Quezon opposed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act which has been passed by US Congress to give Philippine Independence.

Quezon was a master manipulator. His charisma made him a prominent national figure, and his understanding of politics built up a loyal following.
He advocated for immediate, complete, and absolute independence.
He became a symbol of national unity, will, dignity, and desire for independence.

Quezon also manipulated the Filipino people to maintain his power.
He manipulated his friends for his own political ambitions.

Born in August 19, 1878 in Baler, Tayabas (now Quezon Province), Manuel Quezon had a good education at the College of San Juan de Letran in 1894.
After fighting the Americans as an insurrecto, Quezon passed the bar and was appointed Fiscal of Mindoro in 1903, transferring to Tayabas in 1904.
After resigning the same year, Quezon setup a private law practice and began his political career.

Underground pro-independence parties merged to form the Partido Nacionalista after the ban on nationalist parties was lifted in 1906.
Quezon became a close friend of Sergio Osmeña, later leader of the Nacionalistas.
Following the 1907 elections for the Philippine Assembly, which the Nacionalistas decisively won, Osmeña was elected Speaker with the backing of Quezon.

As Philippine Resident Commissioner, Quezon disseminated the Filipino desire for independence to Congress and the American people.
He created a newspaper, The Filipino People, with the American Anti-Imperialist League and figures from the Democratic Party.
While addressing Congress, he did not attack American colonialism, but praised their conduct while noting the Philippine's capability for independence.

As American politics started to favor the Democratic party, the Philippine bureaucracy began to be Filipinized along with a growing Congressional sentiment for Philippine independence.
In 1912, Democratic Congressman William Atkinson Jones introduced a bill for independence but failed to get out of the committee.
In 1914, another Jones Bill passed the House but was rejected by the Senate.
In 1916, it was reintroduced wit the Clarke Amendment attached that guaranteed independence in five years.
Quezon and Osmenña did not support the amendment.

Quezon's growing concern for immediate independence might be detrimental to ilustrado control.
Quezon privately proposed a new organic act for independence in 25 years.

Quezon returned to Manila claiming sole credit for the Jones Act without the Clarke Amendment.
Threatened by Quezon's political presence, Osmenña obtained the leading position in the Council of State.
in 1919, Quezon returned to Washington as head of the first Philippine Independence Mission to obtain further concessions, and replace Osmenña.
Despite support from Woodrow Wilson, Quezon could not do much else to promote independence.

Gov. Gen. Leonard Wood caused dissension within the Nacionalista party, which disintegration Quezon blamed on Osmeña.
Osmeña was charged with having a dictatorial role in the party and the Legislature.
Quezon was then elected President of the Senate, and moved to obtain rapprochement with Osmeña which lasted for a decade.

Now president, Quezon sent several independence missions to Washington which were unfruitful.
In 1927, Quezon suffered from tuberculosis.
He recognized the growing militarism of Japan and worsening Depression, leading to an altered American policy, thus a real possibility of independence.

With the coming of the Depression, the Philippines began to be seen as a liability.
Restriction of Filipino immigration was lobbied along with the curtail of free entry of Philippine goods.
