Joseph F. Hutchinson, Jr.

Quezon opposed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act which has been passed by US Congress to give Philippine Independence.

Quezon was a master manipulator. His charisma made him a prominent national figure, and his understanding of politics built up a loyal following.
He advocated for immediate, complete, and absolute independence.
He became a symbol of national unity, will, dignity, and desire for independence.

Quezon also manipulated the Filipino people to maintain his power.
He manipulated his friends for his own political ambitions.

Born in August 19, 1878 in Baler, Tayabas (now Quezon Province), Manuel Quezon had a good education at the College of San Juan de Letran in 1894.
After fighting the Americans as an insurrecto, Quezon passed the bar and was appointed Fiscal of Mindoro in 1903, transferring to Tayabas in 1904.
After resigning the same year, Quezon setup a private law practice and began his political career.

Underground pro-independence parties merged to form the Partido Nacionalista after the ban on nationalist parties was lifted in 1906.
Quezon became a close friend of Sergio Osmeña, later leader of the Nacionalistas.
Following the 1907 elections for the Philippine Assembly, which the Nacionalistas decisively won, Osmeña was elected Speaker with the backing of Quezon.

As Philippine Resident Commissioner, Quezon disseminated the Filipino desire for independence to Congress and the American people.
He created a newspaper, The Filipino People, with the American Anti-Imperialist League and figures from the Democratic Party.
While addressing Congress, he did not attack American colonialism, but praised their conduct while noting the Philippine's capability for independence.

As American politics started to favor the Democratic party, the Philippine bureaucracy began to be Filipinized along with a growing Congressional sentiment for Philippine independence.
In 1912, Democratic Congressman William Atkinson Jones introduced a bill for independence but failed to get out of the committee.
In 1914, another Jones Bill passed the House but was rejected by the Senate.
In 1916, it was reintroduced wit the Clarke Amendment attached that guaranteed independence in five years.
Quezon and Osmenña did not support the amendment.

Quezon's growing concern for immediate independence might be detrimental to ilustrado control.
Quezon privately proposed a new organic act for independence in 25 years.

Quezon returned to Manila claiming sole credit for the Jones Act without the Clarke Amendment.
Threatened by Quezon's political presence, Osmenña obtained the leading position in the Council of State.
in 1919, Quezon returned to Washington as head of the first Philippine Independence Mission to obtain further concessions, and replace Osmenña.
Despite support from Woodrow Wilson, Quezon could not do much else to promote independence.

Gov. Gen. Leonard Wood caused dissension within the Nacionalista party, which disintegration Quezon blamed on Osmeña.
Osmeña was charged with having a dictatorial role in the party and the Legislature.
Quezon was then elected President of the Senate, and moved to obtain rapprochement with Osmeña which lasted for a decade.

Now president, Quezon sent several independence missions to Washington which were unfruitful.
In 1927, Quezon suffered from tuberculosis.
He recognized the growing militarism of Japan and worsening Depression, leading to an altered American policy, thus a real possibility of independence.

With the coming of the Depression, the Philippines began to be seen as a liability.
Restriction of Filipino immigration was lobbied along with the curtail of free entry of Philippine goods.
Any foreign goods competed with local American goods, adding to the Depression.
Groups such as dairy farmers and cottonseed oil producers lobbied for Philippine independence in order to impose import quotas as a foreign nation.

In January of 1930, Senator William King presented a bill for immediate independence to the Senate. By March, Sentator Harry Hawes and Senator Bronson Cutting introduced a bill for popular election of a Philipipne constituent assembly and a constitution.
Under the Hawes-Cutting Bill, the Philippines would remain under American control for five more years, during which tariffs would be increase.

No trade protection would be dangerous to the Philippines.

Quezon returned to the Philippines in 1929.
Quezon and Osmeña became imtimate political allies.

Early 1930, Osmeña and Manuel Roxas lobbied for independence at Washington.
After returning to the Philippines and conferring with Quezon, Osmeña decided to support the Hawes-Cutting Bill and the Hare Bill with Quezon.

In a call between Roxas, in Washington, and Osmeña, Roxas reported that although apprehensive, Congress was leaning towards independence.
Quezon gave Roxas carte blanche in the pending Senate hearings.

Roxas testified that the Philippines was a financial burden, and independence was owed since a stable government was obtained as stated in the Jones Law.
Political independence was desired but not economic independence.

American labor leaders also testified, enlightening the Committee of the worsening economic conditions.

The Philippines Chamber of Commerce, the American Asiatic Association, and various American exporters to the Philippines spoke out against independence.
American concern with independence rested on economic issues.

Quezon suggested to the dean of UP and Osmeña to organize an Independence Congress.

The Independence Congress met on February 22 and lasted two days, attended by two thousand people.
The Congress authored a Manifesto to be disseminated.
The Congress supported an immediate, complete, and absolute independence platform.

The Depression worsened and hearings were drawing to a close.
Secretary of War Patrick Hurley warned that Filipinos are not ready to govern themselves.

Senator Hawes wrote to Quezon concerning an article in the St. Louis Dispatch quoting him proclaiming a thirty year transition period for Philippine independence.
Quezon denounced the charge and urged immediate independence.
Hawes was unaware of Quezon's apprehension of the termination of free trade.

The Senate Committee, consisting of primarily farmstate Republicans and Democrats, favored the Hawes-Cutting Bill.
The bill provided for a drafting of a democratic constitution, upon which an exclusively Filipino Commonwealth government would function under the ultimate control of the US President.
The commonwealth status would last for nineteen year with increasing tariffs.
Independence would be given via a vote after the transition period.
The bill would not be considered again until December 1931 due to other urgent matters.

While economists tried to deal with the Depression, Japan attacked Manchuria in September 1931.
The US became anti-imperialistic and desired to separate from the Philippines.
Quezon saw the threat of Japan and became against immediate, complete, and absolute independence.

Roxas founded Ang Bagong Katipunan, an alleged non-partisan elite group, to carry the independence issue to the masses.
They stressed economic progress, racial equality, unification of a national culture, and disbanding political parties to approach Washington with a unified polity for independence.
Ang Bagong Katipunan died naturally. Politicians considered Roxas too intelligent to attempt a coup of Osmeña and Quezon, so he was not hurt politically.

Quezon started to favor and push for the Hawes-Cutting Bill.

Quezon's uncertain positions started to become more pronounce.
Quezon supported the Hawes-Cutting Bill with its transition period and economic provisions, which contradicted his platform of immediate independence.
Quezon was unsure of the optimal solution.

After Secretary Hurley visited the Philippines, Quezon dropped his immediate independence platform.
Quezon offered a plan similar to the Hawes-Cutting Bill, sacrificing his platform for a more satisfactory economic provisions.
Osmeña and Roxas agreed with Quezon.

A plan for Philippine independence started to become more concrete.
Quezon, Osmeña, and Roxas held a conservative position, denouncing radical statements by Filipino leaders.

General Aguinaldo and Senator Juan Sumulong of the Democrats considered the proposal a breach of their utang na loob.
Philippine papers criticized the plan as well.
The popularity of the Nacionalistas did not falter.
Quezon, Osmeña, and Roxas were re-elected to Senate President, Majority Floor Leader, and speaker of the House respectively.

President Hoover emphasized that independence would not be feasible economically or politically for the Philippines.
Hurley's War Department considered it a mistake to abandon vital military and naval installation in the Pacific considering the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

While Osmeña and Roxas were sent on an independence mission, Quezon changed his platform again on independence.

A rising in parades and rallies showed the Filipino desire for complete and absolute independence.
Quezon was on the sidelines watching Roxas and Osmeña fight for independence.
To keep his power, Quezon switched to a uncompromising stance of independence.

Because of the Democratic victories, worsening Depression, and Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the US was favorable to Philippine independence, and thus, Quezon's political rivals would get all the credit.
Quezon went back on his agreement with Hurley, and desired guaranteed independence.

Quezon turned against the OsRox Mission in Washington.
Quezon wrote to Resident Commissioner Osias that the termination of free trade would be a disaster to the economy.
Quezon stated that the Philippines would still accept independence under any condition if economic protection could not be achieved.

The Hare and Hawes-Cutting Bill became the center of discussion.
On Philippine independence. Quezon wanted to be the leader of a politically autonomous Philippine Legislature, but wanted economic protection by the US.
Quezon was willing to undermine his comrades' effort to obtain independence because he felt that he alone should liberate his people.
Quezon opposed the OsRox Mission for the next two years until the pro anti fight of 1933.

---

The pro anti fight was waged on two issues: to decide the course of Philippine independence, and who would be the leader of the Filipino people.
Quezon did not want Osmeña to return with an independence bill.
When passed, Quezon attacked the bill on its clause to maintain military bases in the Philippines.

Quezon urged the OsRox Mission to return to the Philippines to discuss the financial issues of the Legislature. The Mission refused to return and trusted Quezon's decissions.
When invited to join the OsRox Mission in Washington, Quezon refused.

Realizing the OsRox would eventually succeed, Quezon purged Osmeña's followers from the civil service and judicial systems on the basis of bureaucratic efficiency. OsRox recognized this move as a weakening of their forces in Manila.

Although previously not making it an issue, Quezon denounced the military clauses and low tariff quotas.

OsRox noted that the military clauses would have to remain as many members of the Senate and House felt these reservation were necessary.

Quezon sent Senator Benigno Aquino to Washington to inform OsRox to not accept the bill unless Presidential intervention was restricted with a higher sugar quota.
Quezon knew Congress would not accept these terms.
Quezon wanted to wait for the Democratic Congress to intervene for a more favorable bill with his health slowly returning.

The Hare and Hawes-Cutting Bill were reintroduced in December 1932 with two amendments: an immigration exclusion, and cutting the free trade quota on raw sugar to half of what was desired.
These amendments angered Quezon and urged OsRox to not accept the bill as a better bill would be possible with the new Congress.
OsRox continued to lobby for the Hawes-Cutting Bill.

The Hawes-Cutting Bill was passed on December 17, 1932.
The Senate yielded to the provision for an increase to one million ton per year sugar quota, and a Filipino immigrate quota of fifty persons per year.
The two Houses settled on a ten year transition period.

According to the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill, the Legislature must convene a Constitutional Convention to write a constitution that is republican in nature and adhere to American principles of government.
The constitution also had to be approved by the US President, then later approved by the Filipino people by vote.
All American property except military bases would go to the Philippine government.
The HHC Bill provided a ten year transition period during which the Philippines would be under an autonomous Commonwealth government.
The US President would have the final say on all foreign policy, and appoint a High Commissioner to the Philippines with limited power.
Tariffs would remain the same for the first five years of the Commonwealth then increase by 5% annually for the second five years.
Independence would occur on July 4, ten years after the inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.

Quezon wrote that the HHC bill was not satisfactory to the Filipinos.

President Hoover vetoed the bill because he considered it inconsistent with Republican policy.
Congress still passed the HHC Bill over the veto, and became law.
The bill was not of immediate, complete, and absolute independence of the leaders' platform.

Since Quezon spoke out against the provisions for Presidential intervention, retention of military bases, low sugar tariff quota, and limited Filipino immigration, he was invited to Washington to obtain further concessions.
Quezon arrived in late March.

Quezon began campaigning against the HHC Act.

Osmeña and Roxas launced a political counterattack against Quezon.
Osmeña urged his followers to create a League for the acceptance of the HHC Act which disseminated pamphlets for the support of the Act and against Quezon's leadership.
Quezon made public appearances denouncing Osmeña's leadership.

Quezon and Osmeña and Roxas came to an agreement. Quezon would accept the HHC Act if the military bases near Manila be evacuated, the transition period be reduced to five years, and tariff clauses modified.
Quezon dissolved the agreement when his followers showed him that they could easily defeat Osmeña.

The antis formed teh Anti Hawes-Cutting League.

With the leaders of the factions returned to the Philippine, the fight between the pros and antis intensified.
Quezon was the first to express his opinion publicly about the HHC Act.
Osmeña was the first to personally slander Quezon.

Osmeña had the support of the Tribune-Vanguardia-Tailba, but Quezon only had a few papers supporting him.
Quezon bought the other major newspaper chain El Debate-Mabuhay-Herald-Monday Mail.

Since UP endoresed Osmeña and Roxas, Quezon attacked the President stating the office should be neutral, and reduced its budget by a third.
Quezon appointed an anti to head the College of Liberal Arts.
Quezon persuaded Theodore Roosevelt to allow him to replace pros in office with antis.
Quezon betrayed the friendship with Osmeña and Roxas when be made public a private conversation over a dead issue.

Quezon was successful in raising funds to fight the HHC Act.
He had the support of sugar centralistas since he claimed the HHC Act did not support sugar trade.

In saying the HHC Act did not protect the Philippine economy, Quezon gained the support of conservative businesses.
By attacking the act for failing to grant immediate independence, Quezon gained the support of radicals.
Quezon also had the support of ilustrados as he strongly influenced the majority of them.

Osmeña challenged Quezon for the both of them to resign, and to let the people decide on the issue. This was a play so the Senate would keep Quezon as head of the Legislature.

By vote, the Senate rejection Quezon's resignation, and accepted Osmeña's.
Roxas was later voted out of office.
Osmeña attacked Quezon stating his anti-democratic actions.

Quezon challenged Osmeña to form a new party, and formed the Partido Pro-Independencia Nacionalista. They had the same ideology as the Nacionalistas except wanted the HHC Act accepted.

Osmeña pressed Quezon to honor his agreement to hold a plebiscite over the HHC Act.
Afraid the people might accept the Act, Quezon proposed a purposefully ambiguous question to render the plebiscite useless.
In the end, no plebiscite was held.

The Senate voted on the Act, and the result refusing the independence offered by the US.

Quezon went to Washington to try to attain a better independence bill.
Quezon propositions were similar to the HHC Bill.

With more urgent matters, Quezon was not greeted enthusiastically.

Although Osias warned Roosevelt that Quezon blocked the HHC Act, Roosevelt supported Quezon and allowed him to lobby Congress to modify the HHC Act.

Quezon presented a proposal to Senator Millard Tyding Charman of the Senate Committee on Territories and Insular Affairs.
Quezon emphasized his objection to military reservations, so Tydings conceded that it would be negotiated at a later date.

Quezon tried to find other avenues of independence through other politicians, but they all proved to be dead ends.
The President agreed to the Quezon-Tydings plan, and asked Congress for a new Philippine independence bill.

Congress passed the Tydings and McDuffie bill.
Roosevelt later signed the bill.
The Tydings-McDuffie act was effectively a copy of the rejected Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act.
The only change was the abolition of military installations, and a promise for a later review of the naval bases.

Quezon was greeted as a national hero upon his return, and claimed sole credit for the bill.

In the elections, the antis won a landslide victory over Osmeña.
Quezon desired a union of the pros and antis for formation of the commonwealth government.
Osmeña realized he and Quezon held identical views, his support group of ilustrados would be harmed by government division, and his political power would be stronger as second in command in a one-party system as opposed to a weaker opposition party.
Many members at he lower tiers of government knew union would be difficult as they fought with each other.
The Nacionalistas reunited on June 16, 1935.
Quezon and President and Osmeña as Vice-President won an overwhelming victory at the polls for the Commonwealth Government in 1935..
