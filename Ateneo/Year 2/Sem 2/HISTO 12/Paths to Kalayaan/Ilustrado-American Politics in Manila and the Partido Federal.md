Revolution has two phases: rebellion against Spain (1896-1898) and the Filipino-American War (1898-1902).

Katipunan initiated the first revolution.
Initially leadership was middle class, non-ilustrados, but shifted to municipal elites.
For wealthy ilustrados, the Katipunan was viewed as a dangerous lower-class movement. To clarify, it was actually a middle-class movement [[How revolutionary was the Philippine Revolution]]; [[Revolutionary Leadership in City and Province]].

After the August 1896 rebellion, wealthy Manila residents were arrested by the Spaniards, implicated by Katipunan leaders. Rizal was executed in December. Many ilustrados spent their time in Spanish jail, while others in exile.
Leadership struggled with intraclass conflict ([[How revolutionary was the Philippine Revolution]]; [[(L) Propaganda Movement and the Philippine Revolution]]).
Struggle for control over the revolution was resolved with the election of Aguinaldo and the execution of Bonifacio. Leadership was also replaced with rural elites loyal to Aguinaldo.

Spanish troops were unable to defeat Filipinos decisively.
With the help of Pedro Paterno, the Pact of Biak-na-Bato was signed ([[The Calm Before the Storm]]).
Aguinaldo left for exile in Hong Kong.

In early 1898, rebellions broke out as Spain attempted to reestablish their authority. These were local conflicts, and not an organized national struggle.
Around the same time Spain came into war with the US ([[A New Colonizer]]).

The (mock) victory of Adm. George Dewey over Manila Bay reinstated Aguinaldo as the head of the revolution.
In less than a year, the revolution transformed into a national movement.
Progress was rapid with the [[Declaration of Independence]] on June 12 1898, establishment of a revolutionary government, and military success of the Filipinos against Spain in Tagalog provinces.
Spain failed to retain loyalty of Filipino elites. Members of the Asamblea Consultiva defected.

By August, the revolutionary government has support from the elites in Luzon.
Leadership filled with prestigious ilustrados during the drafting of the formal Congress inauguration.

Internal conflicts rose from the participation of ilustrados in the revolutionary government vying for influence.
These conflicts manifested in congressional debates, and competition for status in the army.
By the time the Philippine Republic was proclaimed, the leadership shifted from rural elites to urban elites. Wealthy ilustrados succeeded in redirecting the government to their vision of the future.

Filipinos realized the US has no intention to protect them.
Filipino troops were prohibited from entering Manila, and not included in the formal Spanish surrender to the Americans.
The US negotiated for the acquisition of the Philippines in the treaty with Spain, realized with the Proclamation of Benevolent Assimilation.
The US moved aggressively against Filipinos around Manila in 4 February 1899.
By the end of the Filipino-American war in 1902, 3000 Filipinos and 6000 Americans lost their lives.
Some Filipinos and Americans reached collaboration in the midst of war.

# Accommodation and Early Collaboration in Manila
October 1898, four months before hostility with the Americans, delegates of Congress, proposed an autonomous government under an American protectorate.
Autonomista was not well received with American motives unclear. By the December, this position became the most attractive position for ilustrados who opposed the impending military struggle.

Many wealthy ilustrados lacked confidence in the emerging government.
Some doubted the leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo.
Others feared the rise of military relevance.
Others were threatened by the participation of Old Katipunan in government, whose goals differed from urban, western-educated Filipinos. Many ilustrados believed government leadership should be exclusive to them alone.
When faced with the inevitability of war, many ilustrados refused to fight. Many withdrew their support and turned to the US for protection when faced with the imperialistic design of nations, and convinced a war for independence would fail and disrupt the economic system that sustained them.

Early defectors were wealthy and educated men who realized that Americans were not inclined to support Aguinaldo's government. They envisioned progress with a close relationship with the US.
Americonistas collaborated the the American military governor to establish order.
Uncertainty of American objectives was less worrisome than the doubt in the Aguinaldo government, even worse, the effects of war against the Americans.

The Philippine Commission under Jacob Schurman represented the US president and acted as a sounding board for Filipinos in Manila.
Americans learned the concerns of elite ilustrados via numerous meetings.
Filipinos learned: Americans do not intend to withdraw from the Philippines, and envisioned a colonial government that significantly depended on Filipino participation.
In a newspaper, La Democracia, Filipinos opposing the war advocated for cooperation with the Americans.

Felipe Calderon separated from the government and returned to American-occupied Manila.
Civilian court system was reestablished, with a full array of district courts operating throughout Manila.
28 ilustrados were appointed prominent positions in these courts. All levels of the court system was under Filipinos, unprecedented under Spanish rule.

Frank S. Bourns, a medical doctor in charge in improving healthy in Manila, would be essential in the formation of Partido Federal. He devoted significant effort gathering intelligence from native elites, and established close relations with them.

After the beginning of hostilities Bourne asked Gen. Elwell Otis to arrange a reception in Manila for prominent Negrenses and residents of Manila that favored Americans.
Manila residents were reluctant to openly identify as American sympathizers, but Bourne convinced them to participate and lend their support to successfully secure cooperation of Negrenses to prevent hostilities in their province.

Through Bourne, Dean C. Worcester established close ties with leading ilustrados in Manila. Calderon was in close terms with him.
Manila was a focal point for the formation of an emerging collaboration between Filipinos and Americans operating through the military governor.
As military governor, MacArthur developed a favorable opinion to manage state affairs.

Leading collaborators were defined by their education, wealth, and autonomist views.
Central figures were whom resigned from high offices in the Republican government.
They confirmed the belief held by Americans that educated Filipinos desired American rule and association with US institutions and economy.
They promoted the belief that the primary issue was Filipino participation in the government (autonomy) and not sovereignity.

After the American offensive in Central Luzon in November 1899, the Spanish influence lessened, and a more distinctive Filipino-elite social life rose.

The presence of American military heightened uneasiness, and introduced a difference of openness.
The military censored pro-Republic propaganda and war coverage in the provinces. It was permissible to discuss, read, and write anything else.
Significantly, authority tolerated criticism of Spanish religious orders.

Colegio de Abogados, representing the dominant sector of ilustrados, was founded by Calderon in July 1899.

Liceo de Manila, a Filipino-run secondary school, was founded, representing the success of secularization of Philippine education.
Escuela de Derecho, a Filipino law college designed to complement the Colegio de Abogados, was one of the first projects of Felipe Calderon after his return to Manila.
This was also a clear indication that its founders rejected the military struggle, and committed to their aspirations under American sovreignty.
Popularity of Liceo de Manila and Escuela de Derecho spread rapidly.
The guest of honor at the inauguration of the Liceo de Manila was the president of the Second Philippine Commision, William Howard Taft.

# The Founding of the Partido Federal
The arrival of the Taft Commission brought with it the excitement of politically motivated ilustrados in Manila that this civilian body would take over the legislative and executive functions of the government.
The continuing military struggle had minimal impact on the rapidly developing relations in Manila.
Wealthy urban elites reappeared in the Manila scene and complicate politics. Concealed but intense competition for leadership arose within this body.

Many noncombatant officials of the Republican government and writers for the revolutionary press were captured, surrendered, or filtered back to Manila.
Pedro Paterno was also "captured" in April and released in May.

Paterno and Buencamino openly withdrew their support from the Republic, swore loyalty to the Americans, and asserted they were more genuine spokesmen for the Filipino elite.
They:
* called for the establishment of an autonomous Filipino government under American sovereignty and protection;
* stressed their unique abilities to lead the peace movement;
* opposed the annexationist position among the Americanistas.
Although the Taft Commission provided this body to achieve their goals, their inexperience with American dealings and mixed political past led to their discreditation among American authorities.
Paterno and Buencamino then established a group, Comisi√≥n de la Paz, called for a "peace fiesta." This was boycotted by Americans and failed as it was discovered speakers would make nationalistic pronouncements.

With the increasingly close ties, the Americanistas acted as insiders for the Americans.

By the second half of 1900, Manila political activity centered around the relationship between the Filipino elite and American authorities.
Partido Federal, a political group with American backing, garnered the most support.
Other groups, who were less popular and thus less documented, attempted to associate themselves with former officials and military personnel of the Republic. Resident Spaniards also supported these groups. They appealed to young educated Filipinos holding nationalist fiews and hoped for a more autonomous colonial government.
With the expectation of "anti-imperialist" William J. Bryan winning the American election, those not yet affiliated with annexationists positioned for their noncooperation.

The reelection of McKinley shattered hopes for an early American withdrawal.
General agreement was reached to attempt to end the war due to no political advantage can be seen with a continued struggle.
A broad political coalition was worked among leading ilustrados.

General MacArthur embarked on a harsher campaign against the resistance.
Even Paterno and Buencamino were drawn into the coalition, with Buencamino being a critical role in final negotiations.
On 23 December, the Partido Federal was established.

La Democracio was reorganized and reissued as the organ of the Partido Federal, under the direction of Ambrosio Flores, former secretary of war under Aguinaldo.
There was little sympathy and support for the revolution in Manila.

Elites outside Manila were organizing to resist the norteamericanos.
The Filipino-American war spread throughout the country with the Republic receiving support from most provinces by early 1900.
The wide reach of pro-Republic resistance forced Americans to spread, resulting in guerrilla warfare.

In Batangas, many provincial elites notably sustained support for the revolution.
Elsewhere in Luzon, provincial elites sought accommodation with the Americans, reasserting their local power that has by challenged by exacerbated preexisting social tensions during the Revolution.
Provincial and urban elites everywhere were beginning to adjust to American rule.

American civil authorities began to take over political affairs.
They took over the legislative function and composition of the emerging civil government.
To show his desire to end hostilities, Taft demonstrated the American intention to share the government with the wealthy and educated.

In February 1901, the commission embarked on a tour to establish provincial governments with appointed Filipinos.

By March 1901, Aguinaldo was captured and Taft inaugurated as civil governor.
The commission soon became the highest executive and legislative body.

# Taft, the Partido Federal, and the Politics of Patronage
The Taft Commission needed to solve the problem of appointing qualified men in critical positions while rewarding loyal Americanistas
An honest court system was essential for General Otis' program of political education. Initially liberal with his appointments, the Supreme Court consisted for five Filipinos and three Americans, reduced to three Filipinos and four Americans.
Early trends:
* necessity to balance distribution of offices to Filipinos;
* the commission's preference towards Americanistas.

The participation of Americans in high office and the need to provide patronage to regional elites made it difficult for the commission to satisfy politically motivated Manila ilustrados‚Äîurban-based Federalistas.
When the commission reorganized the Manila government, to please Manile√±os, an Advisory Board was created to provide positions to Federalistas as the new city was to be run by Americans.
The executive authority was ruled by an American majority, and the Advisory Board had no real authority.

By the end of 1901, all but one of the leading Federalistas had high governmental positions.
By the start of 1902, the Partido Federal was firmly at the highest level of colonial administration.

Politics of patronage reemerged.
All governmental posts above the municipal level were appointed.
The most desired provincial positions‚Äîjudge, fiscal, deputy fiscal, governor, and provincial secretary‚Äîwere appointive and outside civil service.
Membership in the Partido Federal became the most effective means of obtaining high office.
Jose Alejandro, who played a leading role in the hostilities in Pampanga, was appointed second assistant engineer in Manila with the help of close connections with the governing council of the Partido Federal.

During the American tour from  February 1901, they also aimed to expand the Federalista political base.
As the commission promoted Federalistas in provincial offices, it became clear that access to public office was determined by affiliation with the Partido Federal.
Local committees of the Partido Federal emerged, establishing a political network that covered the Christian Philippines.

The success of the Partido Federal convinced Taft to report to the US Congress that peace has been established with a strong pro-American political party.

As long as appointment remained key to public office and Federalista leadership enjoyed the favor of American authority, the Partido Federal maintained their influence.
