Tenant-farmer: does not own land; rent land from a haciendero
How a hacienda operates
Buwisan system:
* lease land to peasants
* peasants pay rent in full, functions like monthly taxation

Kasama system:
* hacienderos lease land to inquilion who will also lease land to peasants
* peasants will pay through a combination of monthly rent and crop-sharings with the inquilinos and hacienderos
* kasama: peasants who share their crops to their landlords

haciendero (landlord) -> inquilino -> kasama (tenant-farmer)
60% will go to haciendero; 40% divided among inquilino and kasama

During American rule, rich inquilinos became hacienderos from buying land from US
Kasama in indebted to hacendero from buying tools to harvest crops
Land will be passed on to kasama
Hacendero protect kasama from government
