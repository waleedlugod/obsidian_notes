# Origins of Rebellion
By the 1930s, the peasantry was desperate for land.
As landowners became more concerned for profit, their terms became more strictly enforced.

Landowners like Manolo Tinio realized they could earn from farming cash crops, contributing to the spread of Capitalism and a cash economy.
Land ownership became a means to wealth.

Rice and sugarcane were greatest in demand, with the US being the Philippines' principal costumer for sugarcane.

Central Luzon consistently produced more rice than the people living there needed.
Nueva Ecija became the leading rice-surplus province, following were Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Bulacan.
The country became self-sufficient in rice.

Peasants, however, barely had enough for subsistence for a year.
Villagers in San Ricardo often borrowed in order to eat, and could only afford to enroll their children until the fourth grade at the most.
The elites lived very well-off lives.
Peasants were angry at the elites for not sharing their fortune, and keeping in line with traditional values.
Landowners imposed strict contracts, denied rations and loans, hiking rents, and other manipulations.
In return,, they gave less to tenants and passed down their losses to them.

The expanding central government due to American occupation were harmful to peasants as they were weak competitors when taking advantage of the regime's policy compared to local elites.

The American government intended to conduct a cadastral survey, increasing the power of landlords and weakening tenant's.
Landownership was based on a government recognized title rather than the peasant's traditional rights, based on ties to the landlord and continued use of the land.
In an event of a dispute, the landlord's title carried more weight, and could invoke the legal system and police to support his claim.
The cadastral survey and accelerating value of cash-crops prompted local elites to claim land by exploiting their power.

Due to American colonial rule, the local elite's source of power shifted away from the peasants, whittling away their incentive to serve the community by protecting it from the government.
The American regime reached farther in to the provinces than the Spanish.
They also fostered a national political arena, the national assembly and the central bureaucracy, which traditional elites dominated and used to protect their personal interests.

American colonialism also encouraged the expansion of a capitalistic economy, favoring American investors and wealthy Filipinos.
US tariff policies stimulated cash crops for export and inhibited the development for a diverse Philippine economy.
The Philippines became an open market for American goods and undermined Filipino industries, denying rural people an alternative source of income.

These effects were most extreme in Central Luzon.

Unrest and rebellion correlated strongly with the high percentage of tenant farmers in Central Luzon provinces.

# Trying to Adjust in San Ricardo
Many peasants of San Ricardo moved from landowner to another in search for better living conditions.

Tenant farmers took unconventional jobs for added income: cutting wood, raising pigs and poultry, planting vegetables after the palay was harvested.

People had reduced diets, worn used clothes, endured sickness, and had a general lack of income.
Some borrowed rice and cash with high interest rates.

Villages practiced a "share-the-poverty" ethic.
Peasants were paying teams of harvesters 6% of their grain, meaning peasants kept more in the barrio.
Share-the-poverty: families in need of work should be hired first.
During Japnese occupation, peasnats most in need had first claim to glean the fields (pulot).

Peasants demanded that landlords treat them fairly.
Initially this was done in small groups, but organizations slowly formed.

Patricio del Rosario, son of a tentant farmer, later a tenant himself, farmed in San Miguel until he was forty.
During his lasts years in San Miguel, his landlord changed the tenancy arrangements by chargin high interest on loans.
People protested and later formed the Union ng Magsasaka (Peasant Union) to form better relations with landlords.

Del Rosario left San Miguel with his family to find decent tenancy arrangements, switching between at least 6 landlords.

Del Rosario joined a peasant organization in Talavera called Tanggulan (Defense).
Del Rosario was later evicted twice for urging tenants to unionize.
He started to be treated as a leader and wanted all peasants to join one big organization.

Unrest grew with reports of evicting tentants, tenants striking, peasants petitioning for the provincial government to force landlords to divide harvests fairly.
Numerous instances of unrest were among haciendas owned by the Jacinot, de Leon, Cojuangco, and Tinio families.

Tenants for Manolo Tinio was asked to pay more of the agricultural expenses, which he refused. Patricio del Rosari asked a lawyer from the Department of justice to intercede.
Disputes erupted and several tenants went on strike.
Other tenants harvested palay at night while avoiding the guards.
Soldiers from the Philippine Constabulary arrested tenants for "illegally" cutting crops.
Eventually crop was divided, but not without lingering feelings.
