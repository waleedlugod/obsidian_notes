Filipinos who grew up during the American colonial rule nostalgically recall prosperity and peace. Goods were said to be very cheap.
This notion is misleading.
This prosperity will be examined in terms of Philippine colonial economy, the distribution of the labor force, the workers' earning capacity, their socio-economic conditions, who benefited from the free trade system, the existence of widespread worker-peasant discontent, and others.

# The Root of "Pistaym" Prosperity
The establishment of the free trade system by the US Congress on commercial relations between Philippines and America was the root of the notion of "pistaym".
Under the free trade system, American products entered the system without Philippine tariffs as it is its colony (1909 Payne-Aldrich Act).
American exporters can sell their products for a lower price, and benefit from the peso to dollar exchange rate of 2 to 1 respectively.
During the era of "pistaym" were widespread infrastructure programs by Americans.

# Who Really Prospered During the "Pistaym" Era?
The free trade system was established by the desire "to give preferences to Philippine producers and [to] enable American exporters to enjoy the Philippine market."
American exporters acquired a virtual monopoly of the Philippine market.
Little attention was paid to the interest of the Filipinos in the formulation of the Philippine trade policy.

America dominated Philippine foreign trade.
From 1900 to 1909, the US supplied 15.21% ($45,459,084) of Philippine imports ($298,936,198).
After the establishment of free trade, US supplied 61.04% ($684,361,995) of Philippine imports ($1,121,124,419).

P.A. Meyer, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, proudly claimed American capital developed the coconut oil industry, the Manila Electric Company, the telephone system, the sugar mills, the mining industry, shoe factories, petroleum products and distribution, and inter-island shipping. This claim was not unsubstantial.

American investments accounted for half of the $48 million cordage industry; 40% of the $84 million sugar centrals; 43% of the $15 million sawmill industry; and 41% o the $13.7 million logging industry.
Half of the annual gold production was headed by a company owned by an American, Judge John Hausserman.
4/9 of Philippine desiccated coconut factories were American-owned.
Only in fishing, banking, real estate, and retail trade were Americans overtaken by other foreigners.
Half of the annual catch of fish were Japanese hauls.

Chinese controls dominated the real estate business. They rank second in both the lumber industry and banking investments. They control almost 60% of domestic trade.
In Cotabato, they control 90% if the rice milling industry, 90% of retail trade, and 80% of the transportation business.
In Zamboanga, they have a monopoly over the salt industry, and control 60% of the retail trade.

Spaniards also controlled economic life through the Elizalde, Soriano, Ayala, Zobel, and Roxas families.
The mining industry was in the hands of three men: John Marsman, a Dutch Chemist who headed the Marsman group of companies; Andres Soriano, a Spanish businessman who headed the Antamok Goldfields mining organization; and John Hausserman.
56% of investments in banks and banking were controlled by the British through their Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Chartered Bank of India, China, and Australia.

According to the Philippine Economic Association headed by Elpidio Quirino, 70% of businesses were transacted by foreigners.
Filipinos were confined to sari-sari stores.

# The Character of the Philippine Colonial Economy
The free trade system reduced Filipinos to sari-sari stores and merely cultivators of farmhands.

Free trade made it profitable for capitalists to concentrate in the production of Philippine export crops, killing the local manufacturing industries and insuring the economy to be agriculture-based.
The country became dependent on sugar, coconut, abaca, and tobacco.

Sugar accounted for 60% of the total value of Philippine exports.
Two million Filipinos, one million of which were tenants and their families, depended on the sugar industry for their livelihood.
Senator Quintin Paredes noted that the sugar industry was the main support of the Philippine Government.

Coconut accounted for 27% of the total value of Philippine exports.
Four million Filipinos (30% of the total population) were directly dependent on the coconut industry for their livelihood.

Tobacco was the greatest employer of labor in Manila. 600,000 people were dependent on this industry.

Abaca represented 12% of the annual exports. 2.5 million Filipinos were dependent on it for their livelihood.

Half of the total investments in all agricultural industries were in palay. Four million Filipinos depended on it.

By 1939, 13 million out of 16 million Filipinos depended on five crops for their livelihood.
The American market for these export crops was artificial and impermanent.

# The Share of the Filipinos in this "Pistaym" Prosperity
Filipinos were heavily dependent on agriculture for their livelihood, according to the 1939 Census. Their salary was a starvation salary. 3.4 million people employed in agriculture had a PHP 14 average monthly salary.

Half of the 8.4 million employed Filipinos were illiterate, 90% of which were agricultural workers.
Only 1.9 million employed received wages, the rest received irregular income which the Bureau of Labor characterized as "un jornal de hamber" (starvation wage).

Horacio Lava's study concluded that workers in the rural and urban districts received half of an adequate diet. He claimed the true economic conditions of the Philippines can be seen in the rural areas, which constituted 90% of the country.

The National Research Council of the Philippines and the Philippine Islands Medical Association concluded that income, family size, and cost of living determine the kind of food, clothing and shelter a family enjoys.
The starvation wages received by employed Filipinos meant living in the slums, malnutrition, lack of medical attendance, heavy infant mortality, and child labor competing with adults.

85-90% of food intake was composed of carbohydrates, accounting for the malnutrition and susceptibility to illnesses.
Medical practitioners in rural areas found that most deaths were traceable to undernourishment and starvation.

Employers neglected the medical needs of their workers.
In the sugar centrals in Negros, owners spent less than one centavo per day per worker.
A 1938 report by the Bureau of Health states that only 172,605 of the 8 million workers received benefits from medical-industrial treatment laws.

According to an official
	"health is poor, thus farmers were inefficient. There is widespread malnutrition, 15,000 persons die each year from beriberi alone. 85% of the rural population are infected with hookworm and roundworm. Average death rate from tuberculosis is about 275 per 100,000. Infant mortality rate as reported in 1935 was 19, 92 per thousand. Malaria, intestinal diseases are widespread, and epidemics of typhoid fever and cholera are frequent."

Tuberculosis was responsible for 20% of the total annual mortality rate.
Medical practitioners in 1921 concluded these living conditions were of social rather than medical origin.

60% of the 16 million Filipinos did not finish elementary.
A high dropout rate implied a concern of hunger over education.

# Workers' Unrest Contradicted "Pistaym" Prosperity Idea
There was widespread labor discontent and agrarian unrest.
The American High Commissioner to the Philippines observed that agrarian unrest was due to a top down economic progress. Prosperity went only to the Government, landlords, and urban areas.

Workers opposed the usurious practices of landlords.
Serafin Macaraig found that three out of ten uprisings are protests against usury.
Uprisings and movements were colored by workers' discontent whose followers came from rural workers: the Santa Iglesia in Central Luzon; the Dios-Dioses, the Colores, and the Colorums in Southern Tagalog, Bicol, and the Visayas; Papa Isio in Negros; Papa Fuastino in Panay; the Pulajanes in Samar and Leyte; the Ronquillo affair in Cavite; Intrencherado in Iloilo and Negros Occidental; the 1931 Tayug Uprising; the 1935 Sakdal Uprising; the Encallado-Asedillo affair;the growth of the Socialist and Communist parties, and others.
Radicalism spread due to the unhealthy agrarian system.

The names of peasant-workers' organizations were indicative of the socio-economic struggle: Oras Na, Noli, Dimas-Alang, Gabay ng Mahina, Habang Kapatid, Matang-Lawin, Cabesang Tales, Kami Naman, Lingap ng Mahirap, Mabuhay, Wakas Dalita, Timbulan, Tanikalang Mapagtaguyod, Tagumpay, Nagbangon Na, Balintawak, Circulo Vencedor, Nagsumabit, Magpatuloy Tayo, Katipunan ng mga Anak-Pawis, and others.

The intensity of the desire of workers to improve their living condition could be seen in the intensity of responses manifested by the landlords and the government.
The Philippine Constabulary were strategically placed to swiftly suppress rebellious acts, indicative of the extent of radicalism.

The Sakdal Uprising broke out in May 1935.
The Manila Tribune commented on the uprising:
	"The uprising was not an isolated incident ... not merely an outbreak of a few malcontents but the striking symptom of an ailment of the social body – a disease whose roots strike deep into the organism, and whose cure cannot be effected by "conjuring," by spells, and incantations in the form of political platitudes – or even by the devastating surgery of hot lead and cold steel. Suppression has never done anything but stimulate the growth of that which it has sought to suppress. And violent suppression of a popular movement, of popular discontent can do nothing but stimulate that discontent. And sufficiently stimulated, it will break out on a scale on which it will be able to do its own suppressing.
	[They] protest ... against widespread discrimination, against the ostentatious luxury of some officials, against petty tyrannies in some localities.
	The fact that they have publicly expressed their sympathy with the movement shows clearly that thinking men recognized the existence of the disease, the existence of conditions among a great mass of our people which call for a remedy.
	[The Solution] is not by suppressing the movement indiscriminately; not by forbidding the people who have grievances to voice them publicly; not by senseless campaign of subjugation, but by encouraging the free expression, as long as it is peaceful of ideals and complaints.
	For we must never forget that to express an ideal is to express discontent with the real, existing conditions.
	If we are sincere in our professions of Democracy, we must permit the free expression, peacefully and lawfully presented, of the causes which motivate that force. We must listen to that expression, and heed it, and study the real nature of the causes so presented."

# Concluding Comments
"Pistaym" was only enjoyed by the Manila Americans and foreigners who dominated the Philippine economy, by the local elite, and by those landlords, planters, middlemen, those who belong to professional services, to government service, and the trade and manufacturing services.
