Intense rivalries in 1892-1902: Ilustrados vs Katipuneros, Catholics vs Aglipayans,  Manileños vs provincianos, landlords vs tenants, regionalists vs nationalist, pro vs anti-Americans.

While rivalries conflicted, provincial protests ensued for nation building against foreign troops from Manila Bay.
Spanish friars, Filipino nationalists, and American conquerors all dismissed the bucolic experiments as primitive fanaticism.
In an attempt to underline significant national events, the innovations of provincial leaders were ignored.

Rural discord is under-researched.
There is a continuum of increasingly sophisticated dissent throughout the region.

Under conditions of stress—conquest, forced acculturation, rapid socio-economic change—participate in highly eccentric group behavior, coined as "revitalization" by Anthony F. C. Wallace.

Revitalization: deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of society to construct a more satisfying culture. These range from unrealistic to sophisticated/realistic.

Unrealistic revitalization involve a charismatic leader in regular contact with a "supernatural pseudo-community."
Irrationality becomes widespread. Leaders and followers then act as guardian spirits. Authority suppresses challenges to the values of the larger society.

Guardia de Honor: a revitalization effort throughout northern Luzon.

# Catholic origins
Founded by Dominican fathers, its purpose was to instill devotion for the Virgin.
Guardia de Honor de Maria flourished in Pangasinan and nearby provinces.
The society expanded and assumed more responsibilities.

The revolution of the 1890's shattered the Guardia.
Clerics in Pangasinan were arrested by the new regime, others fled to sanctuaries in Manila.

# Relations with the revolutionary regime
Disorder brewed in Pangasinan.
Nationalist leaders opposed the counter-revolutionary tendencies while the threat of hostilities from the US is being dealt with.

Christmas brought uprisings in Tarlac. Cavite is described to have widespread criminal activites.
Martial law was initiated to pacify the populace.
The struggle developed into a civil war.

Aguinaldo was cautious but failed to pacify the area through attraction and coercion.
The organization grew, and by February 1899, it became a general peasant uprising.

After the outbreak of Filipino-American hostilities, provincial leaders turned their focus away from native peace-keeping.
The dissent continued to grow and covered the province by late 1899.

# Relations with the Americans
The peasant uprising caused as much difficulties for the Americans as well.
General Elwell S. Otis regarded the "strange fanaticism" as typical "oriental perversity."
Assuming the sects were motivated by money, Otis ordered a crackdown.
Asked for consultation by Otis, the Manila elites spoke with apprehension about the organization and warned of difficulties "in handling them if they were permitted to follow their inclinations."
Otis found no answer for the source of upset.

Ten thousand people were living in Cabaruan which was thought to encompass 500.
General Arthur MacArthur, finding the source of dissent, moved to eradicate the area.

Regional officers were tasked to handle the complexities of Cabaruan, with an infantry stationed to oversee the dispersal of its residents. The inhabitants did not leave.
Sectarians devoted more time to prayer and less to terrorizing neighboring settlements.
Seemingly, peace is restored and the garrison withdrew.
Soon after, ten thousand more people migrated within a year, and a new religious dissent emerged.

Military personnel were overburdened and reports showed contradictions.
Few people in Cabaruan worked.

Further attempt to understand the source of dissent was undertaken.
A cat-and-mouse game emerged between Cabaruan and the US. Patrol patterns constantly changed; veteran troops made their way to the community via strange routes; a brass band who greeted the troops served as an alarm system who led them to orderly acts.

# Internal structure
Meanwhile, intelligence and legal officers in Dagupan compiled revealing information.
The mystery of Cabaruan was linked to a mass hysteria called "Guardia de Honor."

When the harvest was gathered, farmers from surrounding provinces packed their belongins; sized the landowner's palay and livestock; joined with neighbors; and trecked to Cabaruan.
On arrival, they deposited their rice and animals in communal granaries and pens.
The town lived parasitically on the agricultural yields of the surrounding provinces.

The town was not chaotic.
Although residents opposed external authority—clerical, national, and colonial—they instead followed paternalistic figures.
A pure theocracy was established.

A publicity-shunning individual established the town in 1897, who was believed to be "God Almighty."
Antonio Valdez, headman; Gregorio Claveria, his principal aide; Maria de la Cruz, their companion; were worshiped respectively as "Jesus Christ," the "Holy Ghost," and the "Virgin Mary."
Twelve lieutenants were regarded as the "Savior's Apostles."
A sense of holy invincibility powered Cabaruan.

Although there was no apocalyptic pronouncements, the community believed the millennium was at hand.
They anticipated the eve of a final reckoning. The corrupt world would be transformed; justice would replace oppression.
While awaiting retribution, it was the responsibility of the predestined to strike evil. Blacklists were compiled, particularly of landowners and apostates.
Cabaruan's raiders specifically preyed on those unfit to enter "the chosen kingdom of the Guardia de Honor."

# Overt demise and probable survival as a secret society
Dagupan was more bothered about the town's impossible economy rather than its unorthodox theology.
The soaring population quickly consumed the confiscated communal provisions.
Disputes over the acquisition and distribution of food shook the doctrinal unity of the leaders.
A peak population of twenty-five thousand was achieved in 1901.
The quest for food necessitated a change of tactics. Terroristic bands who attacked selected principales increased assaults on random outsiders. Farmers who previously enjoyed the Guardia activities against the rich turned against the movement when the poor was affected.

Officers in Dagupan moved to still the mounting conflict.
Judgment Day came in the form of infantry battalions.
The "Trinity", "Virgin", and "twelve apostles" were arrested. The confidence of Cabaruan's residents withered, and prepared to return to their old communities.
The uprising was forgotten as quickly as it appeared.

The diaspora took several months with the prodding of American soldiers.
A few faithful remained the Cabaruan to await the military tribunal's decision.
Antonio Valdez and Gregorio Claveria was found guilty on multiple accounts of murder and terrorism, and sentenced to death.
Other leaders received long prison terms.

The aftermath followed the classic model of shattered peasant movements.
	Nothing was left "but the small group of... true believers, and a dispirited mass waiting for the next great moment. And if that small group should be dispersed—by death, or emigration, or the systematic attention of the police, nothing at all remains except a bitter consciousness of defeat."

A spark of revitalization survived, and remnants of the organization formed a secret society which kept the fire of Cabaruan alive.
Provincial officials had to deal with peasant anarchism that shown itself through violent upheavals.
A minor uprising occurred in Natividad in 1903.

In the 1920's a new generation of religious rebels emerged.
Colorum agonies reminiscent of the Guardia's struggles plagued Central and Northern Luzon. The uprising climaxed in 1931 in Tayug, Pangasinan.
