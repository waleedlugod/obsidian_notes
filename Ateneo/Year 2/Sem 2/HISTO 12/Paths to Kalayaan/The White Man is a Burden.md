The White Man's Burden: a poem made to justify the colonization of the Philippines.
White Man's Burden: burden of the white man to civilize/colonize non-whites.
For Filipino: the white man is a burden.
American exceptionalism: American is different from other nations and is the leader of democratic government; White Man's Burden is a representation of this.

United States started as small 13 colonies. They expanded westward, occupying other colonies, and purchased land from European colonizers.
By mid 19th century, they waged war on Mexico and gained southern land.

Manifest destiny: it is the US's destiny to expand their territory in order to spread freedom, democracy, and American values.
It is justifiable to conquer other people.

White love: upon expanding, the white man considers the people they are conquering as friends not enemies; often expressed as paternalistic.
They love these people so much, that they conquer them in order to civilize them.

US role in Philippines is paternalistic.
It was not the intention of the US to occupy the Philippines, but it was a God given mission.
Conquering the Filipino was not hatred but white love.

When US conquered Filipinos, the American public was against intervention in the Philippines as the US might acquire colonies which is what the Europeans are doing.

At the height of the Spanish-American war, the US sent its navy, lead by Commodore George Dewey, to occupy Manila.
Spain and America fought over Manila Bay, signaling the official start of American intervention in the Philippines.

William Howard Taft: Governor-General.
Taft claimed the Philippines were so primitive, it would take more than 100 years to civilize them.

President McKinley claimed the role of the Americans is to help the Philippines create they own nation.
Benevolent Assimilation: The Americas help their colonies becomes a nation where other countries would not.
McKinley needed the support of the American public and Filipino elites to subject them to American rule.

Philippine Constabulary: military police that betrays the Guardia Civil; represented the US civilizing mission.

While the Revolutionaries occupied most of Luzon, the Americans controlled Manila.
Tension between Filipinos and Americans erupted in war.
American never recognized legitimacy of the Malolos Republic and called the war the Philippine Insurgency.
For Filipinos, the conflict was a full scale war.

Strategy of Malolos Republic proposed by General Antonio Luna:
* Make the war unpopular to the American public;
US elections are approaching with the Philippine occupation being the primary subject. McKinely was running against William Bowden Jennings, an anti-imperialist.
* Prolong the war to make Americans suffer high casualties
* If Malolos falls, all military forces will transition to guerilla warfare.
They hope that either McKinley loses the elections or a third party will be involved in the war.

Philippine soldiers are either loyal to Aguinaldo or local commander, not the Republic, weakening their unity.
Antonio Luna reformed the military to have a single uniform, designed by his brother, Juan Luna.

Antonio Luna's mission to attack from multiple directions failed partly due to lack of military unity and lack of effective chain of command.
Soldiers preferred to either receive a direct order from their commander or Aguinaldo.

Americans presented the Phiippines in primitive fashion. Americans claimed Philippines is not a nation as it is divided into multiple "tribes"; Filipinos are inherently different from each other.

McKinely is reelected.
Malolos Republic is suffering from internal conflict.
Antonio Luna was generally unpopular, leading to his assassination.
Loyal supporters of Aguinaldo feared Luna might conduct a coup, but in reality they were afraid of Luna's influence on the Republican army.
Luna was the only General in the Republic that has the capabilities to implement strategies to protect the Republic.

With the assassination of Luna, and rapid shift of the cabinet, with Apolinario Mabini replaced with Pedro Paterno an famous Americanista, the Republic was weakened to resist American rule.

Aguinaldo and the Republic lost Malolos and retreated northward.
Aguinaldo was arrested in Palanan Isabela.
Aguinaldo was forced to take an oath of allegiance to the US, and other generals surrendered.

Filipino resistance shifted from the elites to the masses.
