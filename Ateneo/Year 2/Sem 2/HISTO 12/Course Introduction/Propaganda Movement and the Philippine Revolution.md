During the early 19th century:
1. Latin american wars for independence
2. instability of bourbon rule
3. Carlist wars

Spain lost most of its colonies in the Americas. This was due to the Napoleonic wars. This includes Nueva Hispania/Mexico.
Spain needed its remaining colonies, Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, to be more profitable to compensate the revolutionary wars. Philippines was the only unprofitable colony. This led Spain to implement political and economic reforms.

# Political instability
Alfonso, former king of Spain, returned, continuing Bourbon rule. His succession was debated.
Faction divided between Isabella, his daughter, and Carlos, his brother, to rule Spain. This resulted in civil war called the Carlist Wars, with conservatives supporting the Carlos, and liberals supporting Isabella. 
Once Isabella became queen, she started leaning toward conservatism.
The power struggle between liberals and conservatives were felt in policies and reforms in the Philippines.

Carlos Maria de la Torre introduced multiple liberal reforms, empower insulares and prioles.

# Reforms
## Opening of Manila to world trade
Manila is a primary force of the Galleon trade, monopolizing trade between China and Spain.
When the Galleon Trade ended, Manila was open to world trade. The Suez canal later opened, making it easier for goods and ideas to travel from Europe to the Philippines.
Manila became a hotbed for ideas that dominated Europe, mainly liberalism and nationalism.

## Infrastructure and institutions
Support expected economic growth.
Ferrocarril de Manila, precursor to the modern Philippine Nation Railways. The line connected Manila and Dagupan, operational in the late 19th century.

## Urbanization and businesses
New commercial establishments in Manila and vicinities.
Hotel de Oriente, a 5 star hotel, a symbol of the effects of urbanization on cosmopolitans.

## Education and public health

# Secularization
Transferring the leadership and management of the parishes from the regular priests (friars) to the secular clergy.

Friars:
* convert people to Christianity
* member of a friar order (Dominicans; Franciscans, Augustinians, Jesuits, Recollects)
	* only Spaniards may be part of a friar order
Secular priest:
* lead parishes
* remain in converted communities to provide sacrament
* not member of friar order
* a Filipino priests were secular priests

Local politics were governed by Filipinos who experienced privileged such as freedom from tributo and polo y servicio. These were cabezas de barangay and governadorcillos, collectively principales.
Principales implied risk of rebellion. Colonial government controlled the principales through the parish priests who served as a mediator. Thus it is important that parish priest are loyal to the regime, i.e. Spanish rather than Filipino.
Colonial government and friars refused to implement secularization.

Many secular priests, who were educated, demanded secularization, leading to the secularization movement.

## Leaders
Pedro Pelaez:
* demanded equality friars and secular priests
* believed the issue is within the Church
* died due to an Earthquake, succeeded be Jose Burgos

Jose Burgos:
* believed secular priests were not allowed to lead parishes because they were Filipinos
* issues within colonial society, not just the Church
* not an issue of regular and secular priests, but Spanish and Filipino priest

## Spanish response
Governor general Rafael de Izquierdo claimed the Cavite Mutiny was masterminded by Burgos.
Burgos was later execute, along with Mariano GÃ³mez and Jacinto Zamora, which convinced the emerging middle class that implementing reforms through colonial government is impossible, and can only be implemented through the king of Spain. Many middle class Filipinos supported secularization.

# Ilustrados and La Propaganda
Ilustrados formed a movement to demand reforms, many of whom study in Europe.
Ilustrados were politically vocal middle class.
First to call all members of Philippine society "Filipinos"

# Spanish perspective
## Precolonial
Spaniards describe precolonial as **darkness** because of lack of civilization.
Civilization = Christianity.
## Colonial
Period of **enlightenment**
They brought Christianity and therefore civilization.
As a show of gratitude, the Filipinos are paying tribute to the Spanish king.

Bipartite point of view

# Ilustrado perspective
## Precolonial
Time of **enlightenment**
Time of freedom
Trade with neighbors
Light = progress
## Colonial
Social contract with the Spaniard for progress.
Give up freedom in exchange for Spanish protection.
Spanish oppressed the Filipinos instead. Instead of progress, progress halted.
Time of **darkness**
## Postcolonial
Change is inevitable
No longer a colony
Progress
If Spanish listened to demands of Ilustrados, Philippines will be a province and considered a Spanish citizen
If Spanish did not listen, revolution into a new independent nation.
Time of **enlightenment**

Tripartite point of view

## Versions of the tripartite POV
Different views led to split of propaganda movement into 2 factions:
* Pilarista
* Rizalista
### Marcello H del Pilar
Precolonial:
* Filipinos have inferior civilization.
* Blood compact in order for Spain to civilize and Christianize "daughter" Filipinas.
Colonial:
* Encomenderos charged with civilizing mission.
* Then firars, who establish frailocracia and hamper progress
Postcolonial:
* Friars must go.
* Revolution has surgical advantage.
* Liberal reform is better. Integration of Filipinas with Spain.
### Hayes
Precolonial:
* Ambivalent view
* At first claimed Filipinas to be a primitive state, later believing it to be a civilization with a degree of enlightenment
Colonial:
* Blamed problems to the friars
* Progress is responsibility of Filipinos alone and external forces
Postcolonial:
* Friar rule should be eliminated
* At first favoring assimilation, later desired Revolution
* freedom won "with the blood of Filipinos"
### Rizal
Precolonial:
* had civilization
* armed with own capacities and virtues
* more advanced than Spaniards
Colonial:
* Decay and retrogression under Spanish rule.
* Early colonialism protected Filipinos but was later corrupted
* Filipinos were hard working, but became indolent. Civic virtue lost, Vices taken over. Filipinos forgetting their own culture
* Social cancer in late 19th century due to colonialism
* Frailocracia is a symptom
Postcolonial:
* Nationalism
* Probably through Revolution. Tactically, through reform.

# La Liga Filipina

Second: 1897-1898; revolution of the elites; aguinaldo
Interclass conflict

Reality:
intraclass conflict (middle class)

## Class conflict
Tejeros convention, intended to resolve conflict between the factions, became a conflict between the rural and urban middle class, represented by the rivalry between Bonifacio and Aguinaldo.
Since most in Tejeros were Cavitenos, most voted for Aguinaldo, despite himself not being in the meeting.
Bonifacio was nominated for every position, but lost every  position. Won Secretary for Interior, but position was challenged by Daniel Tirona, a Caviteno, who argued the position should go to a lawyer.
Bonifacio pointed a gun at Tirona, and declaring the meeting null and void.
Bonifacio then established a new government in Naic.
Aguinaldo ordered Bonifacio should be arrested as Bonifacio is counter-revolutionary.
Bonifacio was captured, tried in military court, and executed.
Aguinaldo is completely recognized as the leader of the Revolution.
