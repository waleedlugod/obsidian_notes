After the February 1986 "revolution" which ousted Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, President Corazon Aquino turned the presidential palace, Malacañang, into a museum, putting the Marcoses legacy of excess on display.
The Marcoses had a portrait of themselves depicted as Malakas and Maganda, the first Filipino man and woman who emerged from a bamboo stalk.
In 1985, they commissioned a group of Filipino academics to rewrite the legend in celebration of the Marcos regime.

The Marcoses conceived themselves as "Father and Mother," and having the privileged positions to crass all boundaries, social, political, and cultural.
They thought of themselves as being at the origin of all that is "new."

The Marcoses and their supporters produced a tendentious reconstruction of history—both in the sense of what happened and that which is yet to happen—in relation to prevalent ideas about display of power.
These ideas grew out of the gap between consciousness and social experience in the 1950s and 1960s, as Filipinos sought to reconstitute traditional notions of patronage within the logic of an expanding capitalist economy.
New images of female ambition emerged in film and politics which would establish a context for reworking the positions of leader and follower.
The fact that Imelda Marcos was such an important figure in her husband's career indicates that extent to which national politics became a stage for playing out a generalized nostalgia for patron-client relationships.
This nostalgia focused on the first lady as a prototypical sign for the simulation of patronage within the amoral context of commodity exchange.

# A Man of Destiny, a Woman of Charm
The juxtaposition of Malakas and Maganda was a symptom of an obsession among the Marcoses: to turn politics into a spectacle.

In the presidential campaigns of 1965 and 1969, Ferdinand Marcos often referred to his wife as his "secret weapon."
Imelda's presence was important at political rallies where crowds would wait for her to sing.

Ferdinand's rhetorical style set him apart from other politicians.
The sound of his voice, rather than the content of his speech, commanded attention.

Imelda set a new style of political campaigning in a male-dominated field.
She was a tall and youthful in her formal gowns, generously granting requests for songs.
She always wore ternos, regardless of setting.
In turn, the audience at political rallies became voyeurs, who did not have to articulate their interest but only had to be alert for the appearance of something that would show and tell them what they wanted.

Because Ferdinand and Imelda worked so closely in getting him into office, the public sphere of politics became an extension of their private lives.
Their intimacy was made into a staple of the Marcos myth.

In Ferdinand's biography, he describes himself, before meeting Imelda in 1954, as a sexually active bachelor.
Ferdinand was often romantically linked to other women from prominent families, including the daughter of Manuel Quezon.

Ferdinand first knew of Imelda through photographs in connection with a Manila beauty contest.
He was convinced she was the "Archetypal Woman."

Throughout the development of the "Matrimonial Alliance" there was always a third party to witness the courtship.
This third party was never the couple's parents, but other politicians, journalists, or the "public."
