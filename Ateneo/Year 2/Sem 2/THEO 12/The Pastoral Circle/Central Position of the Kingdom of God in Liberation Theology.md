There is a great need to promote the Kingdom of God in the face of injustice.

Liberation theology, founded by Fr. Gustavo Gutierrez, arose from Latin American poverty and the social injustices causing it.

Liberation theology was criticized for its relation on Marxism.

# Liberation Theology and the Pastoral Circle
The starting point of liberation is the experience of non-persons.
Non-persons: those who the social order does not acknowledge as persons.

Pastoral Circle/Circle of Praxis: a framework to understand structural sin; a single practical experience with four consecutive, inter-related moments.

Steps in doing theology: experience, understanding, judgement, decision.

Responses to socioeconomic poverty:
1. empiricist: poverty is a vice; the cause of poverty is indolence, ignorance, and malice; solutions are diverse; poor are regarded as unfortunates.
2. functionalist: poverty is backwards; the liberal interpretation of poverty; poverty attributed to economic and social lag; solution is reform and gradual improvement of the system; poor are objects of an activity that originates from the top of the pyramid.
3. dialectical: poverty is oppression; poverty is the fruit of the economic organization which exploit workers and exclude others; solution is an alternate social system/revolution; poor are agents of the corrective.

Steps of the hermeneutic circle:
1. immerse into a life situation with the poor;
2. critically examine, through biblical texts, how institutions function in the situation;
3. reflect how the experience might serve a reformation of the teaching;
4. formulate a new statement, social theory, or interpretation of biblical text.

# Social Analysis
Limitations of Social Analysis:
Social Analysis is difficult because of a constantly changing society.
Social Analysis is not a purely objective view of reality.
Social Analysis is not designed to immediately provide a solution.

Approaches to Social Analysis:
1. Historical: how an issue develops over time;
2. Structural: consider the relationships and institutions working together for existence;
3. Value-laden: oriented towards social justice for the liberation of the poor;
4. Non-dogmatic: draw upon a variety of schools of analysis and perspectives;
5. Action-oriented: promoting responses to the social issues.

# New Ways of Looking and Measuring Poverty
The traditional understanding is economic deprivation.
Multidimensional Poverty Index developed to understand the sources of poverty.

Poverty is:
1. basic needs deprivation;
2. inability to manage risks
