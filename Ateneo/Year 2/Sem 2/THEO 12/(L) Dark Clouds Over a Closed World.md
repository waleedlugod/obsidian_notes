4. loss of sense of history leading to division
5. usage of despair and discouragement to gain control
6. human beings are tossed aside, treated as things
7. human rights are not promoted, protected, and guaranteed
8. culture of walls, physically and emotionally, to exclude other cultures; glocalized indifference
9. sense of belonging to a family is fading, dream of working together for justice and peace is an outdated utopia
10. we need to recover shared passion of community and solidarity otherwise the global illusion will lead us to collapse
11. digital communication has not facilitated development of friendship and stable interaction
12. new lifestyle where we create what we want and exclude what we cannot control
