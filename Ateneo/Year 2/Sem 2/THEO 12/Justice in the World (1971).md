There are serious injustices in the world that stifle freedom
Network of domination and oppression
"Action on behalf of justice and participation in the transformation of the world fully appear to us as a constitute dimension of the preaching of the Gospel, or, in other words, of the Church's mission for the redemption of the human race and its liberation from every oppressive situation"

# Justice in the World Society
There is a growing awareness of unity
Equally, the forces of division and antagonism are rising (arms race, nuclear arms, concentration of wealth on the few)
Injustices constitute the nucleus of today's problem (migrants-discrimination; refugees-persecution; restriction of rights of individuals)
Concentration of wealth, power and decision-making to a small public

# The Gospel Message and the Mission of the Church
God revealed himself as liberator of the oppressed
Jesus lived a life o total self-giving and dedication for the salvation and liberation of people
"Because every person is truly a visible image of the invisible God and a sibling of Christ, the Christian find s in every person God himself and God's absolute demand for justice and love"
The Christian message calls us today to dedicate ourselves to the liberation of people
The Church has to proclaim justice and to denounce instances of injustice

Christian love of neighbor and justice are inseparable
Shows effective through action in the cause of justice
The Church has the right and duty to proclaim justice
Involves defending and promoting the dignity and fundamental rights of the human person

Undertake examination of the modes of action and lifestyle in the Church
Rights must be observed within the Church

The Church must continue practicing generous cooperation and spiritual communion including division of human and material resources
Give authentic witness on behalf of justice
