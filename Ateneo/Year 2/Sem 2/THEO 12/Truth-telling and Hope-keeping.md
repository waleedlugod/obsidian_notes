Jesuit-Speak
* cura personalis
* the magis
* "finding god in all things"
* "Ad majorem Dei gloriam"
* **forming men and women for others**

so familiar we miss its challenge

Fr. Pedro Arrupe, SJ
Delivered the summons to Jesuit educational ministers in 1973;
Speech delivered at a Congress of Jesuit Alumni meeting in Spain

# Prophetic Inspiration
Metanoia: wholesale revision of ones life; more than just "change";
Re-imagining in light of the injustices

## A new understanding of church
Pope Paul VI:
Experienced the injustices of global poverty;
Changed his perception of the world

1971 Synod of Ships: Justice in the World

"action on behalf of justice and participation in the transformation of the world fully appear to us as a constitutive dimension of the preaching of the gospels"

constitutional = essential

Dimension of faith/church:
* proclamation of the word;
* celebration of sacraments;
* witness of the loving community;
* **action on the behalf of justice.**

# Arruppe's Blunt assessment of Jesuit education
Jesuits have failed education; education needs a radical conversion.
Because Christ identified himself with the poor and powerless with those hungry and miserable.

The person needed: a man for others.
* gives himself in love;
* humanize the world;
* live simply;
* no unjust profit;
* deconstruct unjust systems of privileges.

Paramount objective of Jesuit education:
* education for social change;
* graduates who are people for others;
* promotion of justice, liberation of oppressed;
* **paramount**.

# How are we doing
Evolution of the phrase:
1. men for others;
2. men **and women** for others (gender justice) for others;
3. men and women for **and with** (solidarity) others;
4. **people** (gender justice) for others.

## Positive
1. Service opportunities are common;
2. Evolving awareness of new issues (climate change, gender equality);

## Negative
1. Professional competence is paramount instead of social change;
2. Paramount goal of social change is not obvious in institutional budgets;
3. Graduates o not see themselves as change agents of liberation;
4. We do not resist consumer culture.

Why?:
1. Appeal to donors;
2. Lack of courage to speak truth;
3. No inspiration of hope for justice;

# Courage for truth-telling
Truth is the basis for justice.

Curricula to foster critical awareness:
1. emphasis on human beings, their needs, contexts, histories;
2. Focus holistic function of education;
3. Political;
4. Multidimensional.

# Hope-keeping
Work for justice, even though odds are against you.
Privileged groups seldom surrender their privilege voluntarily.

Every effort to advance justice leads to the cross.

Hope: to sustain oneself for a **non-guaranteed future**.
Hope exists in between the unlikely and impossible.

Hope is not optimism.
Optimism: easy victory; hero always wins.
Hope: justice ultimately but not always triumphs over evil; risk of paying the ultimate price.

# Justice education and hope
Education should:
* cultivate wonder;
* mature spirituality;
* exposure to the arts;
* encounter traditions.

Justice demands a visionary imagination.

# QA Portion
1. Preconceived stereotypes when recognizing structural sins.
Recognize these labels. Challenge the stereotypes through kwentuhan.

2. How to spread ideology outside jesuits.
Dialogue through Jesus.

3. Philippine context (extrajudicial killings of truth-tellers; marcos era)
People cant be compelled to hope, only inspired.
Remember those who fought before you/with you now.

its a gift of od to humanity; self gifit of god to humanity: grace
