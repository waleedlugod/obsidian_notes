The Second Vatican Council was the twenty first general council of the Church.
Of the 16 documents the council produced, *Guadium et Spes* or *Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World* attempted to read the signs of the times to articulate the best hopes for humanity.

The document emphasizes:
* openness to the contemporary situation;
* church can learn from this world;
* church must help in the process of evaluating what the world has to offer.
