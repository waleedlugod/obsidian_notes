Hannah Arendt
# Lecture 1
* freedom and politics are two sides of the same matter
* in tradition freedom is opposition to politics
* political life exists because we are free
## Is Freedom Real?
* all we know about is partial freedom
* it seems to difficult to demonstrate human freedom as it really is since everything that we do is caused by something; there can't be anything that is uncaused
* are our actions our own or conceived from external factors?
* what action is purely our own?
* why should we be responsible for our actions if our choices are influenced by our environment
* freedom is the basis that allows us to live together
* the debate of freedom as an individual ownership will never end
## Questions for the traditional philosophical account of freedom
* Freedom and interior reality
* Freedom possible only away from political life
	* the farther I am from a political life that influences me, the free-er I am
* Freedom of the will
## Freedom an St. Augustine
* free will - conflict
* conversion - giving up of free will so Diving will can take over
* what is the problem with finding comfort in your own private sphere

# Lecture 2
* freedom is not an individual possession
* freedom is manifest in the unpredictability of action (interaction)
* freedom is between "you" and "me"; "it is neither in the "I" nor in the "you" but in the in-between"
* prioritizing security is problematic
## Politics for the sake of security is not politics
* protecting your own private interests
	* individual interests pertaining to own biological survival
* private interests always on the verge of clashing with other private interests
* becomes problematic when politics revolves around securing own private interests
* incentive to grow its strength against conflict
* will-to-power; will-to-oppression
* competition instead of participation
	* cold war
* concern for growing profit
* security - logic of survival, biological necessity
* no sense of shared space
* erases the possibility for our ability to disclose our individuality
## What does it mean for politics to exist for freedom?
* action is an ever-present reminder that men are not born in order to die but to begin something new
* we are all beginnings
* to participate in politics is to create and nurture the space for everyone to be beginnings
* desire to assert own irreplaceability/individuality
	* this desire appears most clearly when our irreplaceability is not recognized, respected
* effaced - from the French *effacer* - literally to obliterate the face
* no one can say "yes" or "no" for ourselves. no one can respond for ourselves in communicative interaction
## Our nativity
* when we find ourselves doing things out of our won initiative
* when we can honestly tell ourselves that we are not forced by other and circumstances to say and do things
## When do I know that it is really from "I"
* our freedom to disclose myself must be before the "unpredictable other"
* when you are not afraid to be identified as the other / the source of that action
## The disclosure of my individuality is just one part of freedom
* because the shared space is not possible, we are not able to disclose our individuality
	* this shared space is politics
* "freedom appears in the plural"
* the reason why my individual appears is because I am responding to another individual ([mutual gaze](Person.md))
* in the mutual respect for each one's capacity to begin something new, freedom appears as this shared space of recognition (the public realm)
* i am not able to appreciate the individual other without freedom/the public space
* freedom is when you step out of your private space and share the public space with others
## World building
* the challenge: how to live together while mutually respecting each other's uniqueness
* (insert picture from slides)
* we create a world by reconciling subjectivity and objectivity
## The public realm
* Philippine Plaza
* the common space allows us to disclose our individuality/vulnerability [[Rethinking Vulnerability]]
