Judith Butler
# Lecture
* gender identity is performatively constituted
* performative is that enacts or produces that which it names

# Lecture
* equality is rooted in interdependency/shared vulnerability
* liability model of responsibility
* fault does not exclude responsibility
* our current sense of "I" is not our original sense of self; our sense of self is constantly reforming
* interaction with the "you" affirms the idea of existence
* even in during a heated argument, you are recognizing the other as someone capable of consciousness
* exposing vulnerability welcomes retaliation
* exposing vulnerability is itself protest
* "look at me" "look at what has been done to me"
* precarity; systemic violence
* exposure of the body - as vulnerability
	* a needing to be clothed, cared for, sustained
* exposure of vulnerability as resistance: the [standing man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdem_G%C3%BCnd%C3%BCz)
* the exposure of the vulnerability of bodies articulates the demand that only a supported life can persist as a life
* "the knotted position of the subjugated subject by exposing its own subjugation"
* life requires infrastructure, not simply as an external support, but an imminent feature of life itself
* we are all part of the system that perpetuates the oppression to those who are precarious
* although we are not at fault for oppression, by participating in the system, we are perpetuating it
* how is the suffering of others related to me?
