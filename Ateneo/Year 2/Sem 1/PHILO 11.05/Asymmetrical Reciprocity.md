## Challenges of political life
The face of our natality is also the the fact of our uniqueness and unpredictability.
Unable to calculate the effect of action/our expression of our uniqueness on others.
Unable to simply undo the effect of our actions on others.
Forgiveness and promises - the remedy/the source of stability.
The question of justice.
You cannot control how others respond to your uniqueness.
Political institutions are products of trying to harmonize our actions.
We don't need to love one another to live together [[Rethinking Vulnerability]].
## Text
> To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who share it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it. The world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time.
> - Hannah Arendt

The world is space where we can gather together like a dining table.
Even though everyone threats our natality, we still live together, which is what it means to live in a political world.
In the capitalist system, the aim to maximize profit supersedes the idea to live together. The concern for own survival makes it difficult to think about the common world. [[Rethinking Vulnerability]]
## Reciprocity
Mutuality
Implies a relationship
Reciprocity between self and the world/political community
Reciprocity between the self and Self [[The Value of Philosophy]]
Reciprocity is assumed as symmetrical, but relationships between individual persons is asymmetrical.
## Can we expect symmetrical reciprocity in the polis?
Classic understanding: impartial point of view/to look at everyone as equal.
Symmetrical reciprocity is not synonymous with everyone as the same.
Concept of equality is an abstraction. [[Insight]]
## Iris Marlon Young's critique
The assumption of symmetrical reciprocity is problematic.
1. The call to reverse perspectives can lead to effacement of the other's uniqueness (ex. When someone says "I know what you're feeling", but then talks about their own experience)
* Projection of one's own fears and desires
* Silencing of the other's experiences
* Imposing my own understanding
Happens when I see the other as my complement, however the other is not a part of you.
2. Impossibility of reversing perspectives
Our perspectives are not fixed standpoints, they are fluid
Our perspectives are influenced by other's perspective of us
Intersectionality
3. Perspectives are not always equally legitimate (especially in the absence of distribution of power)
It's an insult to ask a victim to reverse perspectives with the perpetrator
The problem of those with more power and privilege who try to understand the underprivileged
## Dialogue as gift-giving
Gift-giving is asymmetrical in nature
Not transactional
Still reciprocity without demanding for return. Accepting is reciprocating
## The encounter with the other
The encounter with uncertainty
Disrupts my isolation
Calls the person in me into being [[What is Freedom]]

>The task of a human person then is to face the tension between our abstractions and our everyday reality. It's hard but do good anyways.

# Reading
People often consider the point of view of others when discussing moral issues. This becomes problematic when systematized into moral theory.

>It is neither possible nor morally desirable for persons engaged in moral interaction to adopt one another's standpoint.

Asymmetrical reciprocity rather than symmetrical reciprocity.
A theory of communication leading to moral judgement should be similar in structure to gift giving.
Must distinguish between taking perspectives into account, and imaginatively taking their positions.

## Moral Respect Conceived as Symmetrical Reciprocity
Benhabib believes that a person must understand the position of the concrete other as symmetrical and reversible to acknowledge their value, morally. A person is able to make judgements that take the needs and interests of everyone equally into account because she has imaginatively represented to herself the point of view of all those others.

## Three Stories of Irreversibility
Problematic examples of the idea of moral respect as taking the other person's standpoint.
### I'd Rather Be Dead Than Crippled
Oregon denied people with disabilities reimbursement for some procedures it would reimburse able-bodied people. (????)
State officials gave people with disabilities lower priority because they believed their lives as less important.
This was justified from a telephone survey for determining their priorities. The majority of respondents said they would rather be dead than crippled.
The statistics of suicide among people with disabilities is low, and usually think their lives are worth living.
Able-bodied people fail to imagine the point of view of others; rather project their own fears.
### Going Native
The indigenous peoples of North America have been constructed by whites as romanticized figures. They are thought to have a noble authentic relation to nature, with a deep and meaningful social, cultural, and religious life.
White people wish to practice the Indian way of life.
Indians expressed sadness more than anger; they insisted that because the whites lack the personal and group history, they cannot adopt and Indian standpoint.
Indians are suspicious of whites effort to take their standpoint, because it is  motivated by a perception of cultural poverty of white society. This desire to understand an Indian perspective may be a form of cultural imperialism.
Indians prefer a stance of respectful distance, and acknowledgement that whites cannot reverse perspectives.
### Getting It
When Anita Hill was sexually harassed, many men did not believe her. Many women told these man that their sexual privilege prevents them from understanding why Hill did not file take action at the time.
Many white feminists claimed that they did "get it" when African-American women denied it. For them, the case did not simply concern sexual harassment, but racial drama that white society was acting out its fears and power struggles.

>There are certainly dynamics of sexual privilege between African-American men and women, but when these come before a white public, they are so intertwined with the dynamics of racism that other women simply cannot take the perspective of African-American women.
## Critique of the Idea of Symmetrical Reciprocity
Arguments against the claim that moral respect requires symmetrical reciprocity.
### Obscures difference
The mirroring evoked by ideas of symmetry support a projection of sameness at the expense of their differences.
The gender system structuring Western culture and philosophy presents the feminine as a complement to the masculine subject. Woman functions as a mirror in which the male subject can see himself objectified, bounded, and determinate.
The subject puts themself in the place of the other in order to return reflectively to themselves, silencing the other in the process.
While individuals may have many things in common, they could rarely be said to share everything.
The result of the effort to see others as symmetrical may sometimes be a projection of a perspective that complements oneself. This cannot be corrected without the other's ability to engage, confront, and create dialogue.
### Impossibility of reversing positions
To recognize the other person is to acknowledge that she is an "I" to herself just as I am an "I" to myself, likewise with being an other.
Each person's identity is a product of her interactive relations with others.
By this knowledge that the other has a perspective of me that is different from my immediate experience of myself, I experience them as subjects. This relations is specifically asymmetrical and irreversible, even though it is reciprocal.

>The infinity of the dialectical process of solves in relation to others both makes it impossible to suspend our own positioning, and leaves an excess of experiences when I try to put myself in the others person's place.

Revering perspectives neglects to conceptualize the relation between us.
### Politically suspect
Many contexts of moral interaction involve members of groups that stand in specific privileged and oppressed positions with one another.

>Where the perspectives are also constituted by relations of privilege and oppression, it is even more difficult to envision that one of these perspectives can take the perspective of the other.

When privileged people put themselves in the shoes of those less privileged, assumptions from their privilege misrepresent the other's situation.
The damaging stereotypes often function to legitimize the privileges of the privileged groups and undermine self-respect of those in oppressed groups.
The idea of reversing perspectives assumes that both perspectives are equally legitimate, which may not be true where social injustice exists.
It is more appropriate to arrive at a political judgment with a stance of moral humility. With mora humility, one assumes that they cannot see things from the other person's perspective, and waits to learn to what extent their experiences overlap.
## Asymmetrical Reciprocity
Moral respect entails reciprocity, the recognition of the other irreducible points of view.
Each brings a history and structured positioning that makes them unique.
Opening up to others is a gift; the trust to communicate cannot await reciprocation, or else the conversation will never begin.
Communication is a creative enterprise that presupposed the irreplaceability of each other's perspective.
Perspectives of subjects are asymmetrical in two ways: temporalty and position.
Each person brings an inexhaustible history which result in their unique experiences, assumptions, meanings, etc.
Each social position is structured by the configuration of relationships among positions, which themselves shift. However, the positions themselves cannot be removed from their contextualized relations and substituted, despite the shifting of relations.
## Understanding Across Difference
>Communication is sometimes a creative process in which the other person offers a new expression, and I understand it not because I am looking for how it fits with given paradigms, but because I am open and suspend my assumptions in order to listen.

Communication is like chess, new variation of moves are created that cannot be anticipated by the rules, but are part of the game nonetheless. Other people offer new variations of their reality that are beyond my experience, and I come to understand them because they explain them to me.

>We meet and communicate. We mutually recognize one another, and aim to understand one another. Each is open to such understanding by recognizing our asymmetry. A condition of our communication is that we acknowledge difference, interval, that others drag behind them shadows and histories, scars and traces, that do not become present in our communication. Thus we each must be open to learning about the other person's perspective, since we cannot take the other person's standpoint and imagine that perspective as our own. This implies that we have the moral humility to acknowledge that even though there may be much I do understand about the other person's perspective through her communication to me and through the constructions we have made common between us, there is also always a remainder, much that I do not understand about the other person's experience and perspective.

## Giftgiving, Communication, and Wonder
There is equality and mutual recognition in giftgiving. For ther to be a gift, there must be no reciprocity, return, exchange, countergift or debt.
Giftgiving is an asymmetrical reciprocity in two ways: gifts are not equivalent, and moments of gift giving are separated by time, i.e. they are unique in position and temporality.
Every speech act at understanding entails and offer, and understanding of the speech entails an acceptance. I do not respond to your statement by saying the same thing back to you, but by making a different statement.
Communication entails moral respect and mutual identification, but also wonder of an openness to the newness and mystery of the other person.
A respectful stance of wonder is one of openness, awaiting new insight about their perceptions; also being able to see one's own position as strange when put in relation to others.
## Enlarged Thought
Enlarged thought is supposed to explain how a person moves from a narrowly subjective self-regarding perspective on action to a more objective and socially inclusive view.
>We make our moral and political judgments, then, not only by taking account of one another's interests and perspectives, but also by considering the collective social processes and relationships that lie between us and which we have come to know together by discussing the world.
