1. “Being a person is being self-aware, but this is inseparable from being open to different significances, and being open to strong evaluations, which are bound up with language.”
	1. being a person is being aware of the "I" which can only occur after the distinction between the "I" and the "other"
	2. individuation through clashing between the internal and external
	3. therefore one can only individuate by being open to different significances and strong evaluations. these values clash and we internalize the conflict to reconstruct our identity
	4. language is the medium we can be in conflict with others; it is how we are given access to the external world and interact with it
	5. language gives us formulation and allows us to be classify things i.e. our significances
2. “Do we not first become aware of ourselves in the gaze of another person? In your gaze as that of a second person who speaks to me as a first person, I become aware of my self not only as a conscious subject but also as a unique individual.”
	1. Charles Taylor on what it means to be a person
	2. through the recognition of the "other" of us as an "other" to them, we are able to distinguish the "I" and the "you"
	3. this is not the same as descartes idea of consciousness. descartes believe that consciousness is a trait we have. however we do not simply have personhood. personhood occurs from the conflict of the values of others
	4. personhood is up to constant restructuring due to our interaction with the "other"
	5. separation -> gaze -> crisis
3. The deeper the process of individuation shapes the inner life of a person, the deeper she becomes entangled in an ever denser and more fragile network of relationships of mutual recognition. In the process, she exposes herself to the risk of reciprocity being denied.
	1. individuation through separation of the self -> gaze of the other -> crisis
	2. because of the inseparable link between the "I" and the "you" it is not right to think of a person of a connected network of relationships which we call the public sphere
	3. in the process of participating in this public sphere, we reaffirm our personhood as well as the personhood of others. in conversation we recognize the other as capable of thoughts that are separate to ours which is why we conversate, to understand their experience
	5. according to habermas, the body is defined by the social relations that bear upon its persistence and therefore requires infrastructure to exist. infrastructure is a feature of life
	6. moreover to participate in this public sphere, one must expose their vulnerability. exposing ones vulnerability brings the risk of retaliation. the need for infrastructure does not guarantee that it is one of exploitation or love. this vulnerability can be taken advantage of by others
	7. American healthcare system; EpiPens costs around $300 each at retail yet only $20 for production
4. We need to re-imagine an egalitarian society that is grounded on the insight about our fundamental vulnerability and our radical interconnectedness. We need to oppose violence with the force and strength of nonviolence, one that is manifest in solidarity alliances of resistance and persistence.
	1. we need a society that is not just equal, but recognizes our shared vulnerability, meaning the social relations that binds one another
	2. each person is given over to another; dependent on another. that the privileged depends on the unprivileged just as the unprivileged depends on the privileged
	3. people living paycheck to paycheck are dependent on social security nets. the rich are dependent on the poor for their incredible wealth
	4. jeepney strikes. the drivers are dependent on commuters for a source of income. these commuters depend on the drivers for their own livelihood, who are in turn, the source of dependence for other people, especially of high privilege
	5. people are radically interconnected; people are defined by the social relations that bear upon its persistence
	6. to oppose these violence is by exposing ones vulnerability; to insist that they are a life worth living. exposing vulnerability is protest. the body points to the violence it is exposed to yet still exist where their powers are systematically undermined
5. The goal and ends of politics is not security, but to establish and nurture the fragile space where persons may gather together as actors (beginners). Freedom appears in action, in the disclosure of ourselves as beginners, before others who are just as unpredictable as our selves.
	1. politics for security: protecting private interests. incentive to grow in strength against threats to own interests. competition instead of participation (cold war)
	2. there is no sense of shared space in politics for security as the shared space becomes a means to protect private interests. the loss of the shared space results in our means to assert our individuality
	3. people are referred to as beginners. each new existence of a person is a new beginning; the beginning refers to the start of their existence. because a person is a beginning, every action they do is something completely new; something they begin themselves
	4. there was no person nor will there ever be a person that is "I" other than "I". I am the only person that is myself, therefore every action I take is something new, a beginning. This ability to create something new, to begin something is where freedom manifests. Freedom is not a possession but a manifestation from our actions
	5. One aspect of freedom is expressing our uniqueness, our irreplaceability; to announce our existence and that our life is one worth living
	6. Because we are free, we are then separated from an accumulation of causation leading to the present moment. I am unable to control how others respond to my uniqueness, so they are unpredictable
	7. Disclosure of ourselves and not being afraid to be identified as the source of action
6. To be political is a distinctive feature of our human condition. It is the art of learning how to live together amidst the possibility of conflict, to share in the task of taking care of the world, “which existed before us and is meant to outlast our lives in it.”
	1. our personhood is defined by our interaction with the other. our identity is affirmed and reconstructed from the "gaze" of the other. we in turn do the same to them.
	2. this mutual relationship can only be done through the public sphere, a space where we can recognize one another as beings with an infinity of history, experiences, and perceptions unique from mine
	3. In the public sphere we are bound to clash with the strong evaluations of other people. By participating in the public sphere, we are exposing our vulnerabilities, meaning we announce that we still exist despite the violence of systematic oppression. In exposing our vulnerabilities we are at risk of retaliation
	4. the art of living together - asymmetrical reciprocity. We acknowledge that there is an infinity of difference in perspective and history between us, and assume we cannot understand everything. Here we listen to the other and understand through our overlapping experiences, keeping in mind their remainder of experience we cannot understand.
	6. We are beginnings because we are thrown into a world that has existed before us, and so it is our duty keep this world safe for beginnings of the future.
7. Retrace the salient points of your group discussion on “The Arbitrariness of Things.” What were your points of agreement or disagreement? Did you arrive at a resolution? In what ways did your group discussion illustrate what it means to be political? Show how some of our philosophers in modules 2 and 3 served as helpful partners in your conversation.
	1. We agreed the Puka Luka Vega's actions were not criminally wrong.
	2. We agreed that their interpretation of Jesus is no different from other interpretations, especially ones from Catholics.
	3. We both agreed that because of drag as an artistic medium, it is important for people to express themselves, and Luka's rendition of Jesus was just that.
	4. It is weird how portrayals of Jesus in special events or in entertainment is praised, yet Luka's representation is targeted.
	5. I think this is an example of how symmetrical reciprocity becomes problematic. Giving the benefit of the doubt that people attacking Luka tried to understand his perspective, they brought their fears and prejudices with them.
	6. Drag is has strong ties to LGBT representation, which is problematic to conservative Catholics. Then in the attempt to put on Luka's shoes, they project their prejudices and conclude that Luka's performance is blasphemous.
	7. An example of clash of great evaluations. Being their ideas of blasphemy, with Luka's beliefs being significantly more lenient than their haters. As well my own clash of ideals. Through language, by writing my thoughts, I was able to reconstruct my values. Before hearing about the incident, I was more of indifferent to these types of religious issues since I am not religious. But in reassessing by strong evaluations, I think I am leaning on more of a defender of Luka.
