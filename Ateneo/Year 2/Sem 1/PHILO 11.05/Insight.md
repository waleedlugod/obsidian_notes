* philosophy is associated with thinking, and insight is crucial in thinking
* insight is seeing with the mind

significance of an insight:
1. the insight itself
2. what to do with the insight
	1. analysis can deepen and clarify the original insight
	2. crystalize into metaphor to shed light on another aspect of reality

the meaning of four involves a preparation of two abstractions
1. the abstraction of aspects of the object being counted e.g. toyota as cars; carabao & dogs as animals
2. the object itself is abstracted i.e. the meaning of four is not four cars or four animals but simply four

abstraction is a tool for insight
abstraction is to focus on one aspect  of a thing while prescinding from its other aspects
concept: abstract thought
conceptual analysis: analysis by abstraction

conceptual analysis can dessicate an insight
* the complexity of men can be abstracted down to a fund of energy and high spirits
return to the concrete fullness of the original insight after conceptual analysis
when a return is made, the insight is deepened; when a return is not made, the insight is fossilized

when we clarify and deepen an insight, we do something with it

techniques mentioned to do something with an insight
1. conceptual analysis
2. metaphor

some insights are inexhaustible by our efforts to clarify them; superabundance of the original insight
state of tension between knowledge and ignorance

insight permeates the process of doing something with an insight
we need insight to recognize that doing something with an insight leads to a deeper understanding instead of classifying superficial aspects

insights that are superabundant bring us to the heart of reality as reality is superabundantly rich
the richness of these insights is the richness of reality itself
a human being facing reality is between knowledge and ignorance


# Questions
1. When Ferriols says that insight means "seeing with the mind," what is it exactly that the mind "sees"?
a deeper understanding of reality. aspects of reality that are not immediately apparent

2. Find out more about the meaning of "procrustean bed" and relate how similar this is to what Ferriols refers to as the "dessication of reality."
procrustean bed refers to the bed of Procrustes which was offered to travelers, but was never the right size. Instead of altering the bed, the travelers themselves are altered to perfectly fit the bed by cutting limbs or stretching. This relates to what Ferriols mentions as although abstraction is a useful tool, we can also abstract away certain aspects of insights to fit a claim. In other words, abstraction can take away the spirit and richness of the original insight. This it is important to return to the original insight to gain a deeper understanding.

3. What are some practical consequences of "dessication of reality"? Or, how do you see dessication of reality at work in everyday life?
Dessication of reality can be practical as it simplifies processes that do not need to be fully understood for them to function. An example would be computers as they can be seen as a black box. However, the abstraction of the inner workings of a computer allows the everyday person to utilize it easily.

4. Give an example of how conceptual analysis is helpful.
It can be useful in statistics as you can abstract the student body into different courses, and gather data with that as a focus

5. Demonstrate the insight behind an example of a metaphor - poetry, painting, music or any metaphor that resonates with you.
