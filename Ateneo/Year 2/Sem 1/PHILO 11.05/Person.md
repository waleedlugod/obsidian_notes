## Person as consciousness
* Descartes: clear separation between internal reality of consciousness and the world outside (not-Self)
	* consciousness as separate from the body; body is just a tool
* self-consciousness and intrinsic agency
* modern civilization - exaggerated confidence in the human being's capacity of self-consciousness
* modern person - characterized by a purposive rationality (self-assertion of Russell)
* consciousness as as the calculative observer, world as the calculated object

* a person's actions are driven from within/intrinsic motivation
* person is as an agent-plus due to self-consciousness

* a being-in-the-world
* world: space that has been worked on, molded by human hands
	* if it doesnt make sense, it does not have a place in the world
* a being has always already exists in the world
	* the moment of existence they are in the world
* a being cannot be a being without the world, the world cannot be a world without a being
* Marie Kondo's philosophy of having a joyful relationship with the world (this does not spark joy girl)
* objects that sparks joy feels like they are apart of you
	* intimate relationship with certain objects (e.g. favorite clothes)
* who we are transformed by the objects we are connected to

* we are not a detached spectator of the world
* detachment is a moment of abstraction from the world
* we are always in the world
* presence in the world is also presence to self
* knowing the world is also knowing the self
* caring for the world is also caring for self
# Summary
* a-being-in-the-world
* we are transformed by others as others are transformed by us
