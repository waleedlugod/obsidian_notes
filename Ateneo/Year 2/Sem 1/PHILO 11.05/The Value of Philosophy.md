* is philosophy more than innocent but useless questions which knowledge is impossible
* physical science is useful because of its effect on general mankind through inventions
* the primary value of philosophy is not found on the effect of mankind as these proceed indirectly from those who study it
* practical man: solely recognizes material needs
* goods of the mind are at least as important as the goods of the body
* philosophy is found in the goods of the mind
* knowledge which gives unity to the body of sciences which results from a critical examination of the grounds of our convictions, prejudices, and beliefs
* philosophy does not concern subjects with definite knowledge
	* study of heavens -> astronomy
	* study of the human mind -> psychology
* it is part of the business of philosophy to consider answerable questions to make us aware of their importance, examine all approaches to them, and keep alive the speculative interesting in the universe
* the value of philosophy is sought in its uncertainty
* a man of prejudice lives in a world of definite, finite; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliarity are rejected
* diminish feelings of uncertainty but greatly increases our knowledge on what things may be; removes the arrogant dogmatism of who have never travelled the region of liberating doubt; keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in a unfamiliar aspect
* chief value from the greatness of objects of interest and freedom from bias resulting from contemplation
	* life of instinct: within circle of private interest; outer world is not regarded; feverish and confined; small in the midst of a great world which will lay our world in ruin; garrison in a beleaguered fortress; strife between desire and powerlessness of will 
* life of philosophy: calm and free
* philosophy does not divide the world into a binary, it views the whole impartially
* does not prove that the universe is like man
* enlargement of the self, but best attained when not directly sought
	* obtained when the desire for knowledge is alone operative, by study which does not wish in advance that its objects should have this or that character, but adapts the Self to the characters which it finds in its objects
	* not obtained when we try to show that the world is so similar to the Self that knowledge of the world is possible without any admission of what seems alien
		* this is a self-assertion and is an obstacle for growth
	* contemplation start at the non-Self and the Self is enlarged through its greatness
* knowledge is the union of the Self and non-Self
* impaired by dominions and force into conformity
* tendency towards the view that Man is the center of the universe and anything not created by Man is unknowable
	* untrue
	* robbing the value of contemplation
	* not the union of the Self and non-Self; set of prejudices making an impenetrable veil between us and the world beyond
* true philosophic contemplation finds satisfaction in the enlargement of the non-Self
* self interest and bias distorts the object of interest and impairs the union for knowledge
* free intellect will value abstract and universal knowledge which private affairs do not affect
* a mind accustomed to freedom and impartiality of contemplation views its purpose and desires as part of the whole not infinitesimal fragments where the world is unaffected by them
* contemplation enlarges not only objects of our thoughts but also objects of our actions and affections; it makes us citizens of the universe not a walled city at war with the rest
* philosophy is to be studied not for the sake of definite answers but for the sake of the questions themselves; these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich intellectual imagination and diminish dogmatic assurance
* above all, through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, and mind is also rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good

## philosophy as a journey
* meandering, confusing path
* getting lost becomes valuable

## the value of philosophy
* the notion that use = value
* how do you feel that the value of philosophy lies in its uncertainty
* value in tarrying by appreciating what we have passed
