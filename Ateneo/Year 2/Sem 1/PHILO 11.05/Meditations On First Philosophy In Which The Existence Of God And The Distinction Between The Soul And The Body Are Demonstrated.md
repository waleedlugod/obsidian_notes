## Meditation One: Concerning Those Things That Can Be Called into Doubt
* the basis of our opinions are doubtful
* restart anew to establish opinions that are not false
* clear mind from distractions, period of leisurely tranquility, solitude
* reject all opinions with reason for doubt
* undermine the foundations instead of surveying each opinion
* senses deceive us, how can we distinguish asleep from awake
* assuming that we are dreaming: all content is produced in the likeness of true things, like painted images
	* sirens and satyrs are a fusion of animals
	* colors are true
	* the simplest components are true
* disciplines based on composite things (physics, astronomy, medicine) are doubtful
* disciplines based on atomic foundations (arithmetic, geometry) and are indifferent on their existence are true
* we may still be deceived in simple things the same way people make mistakes in matters they believe they know perfectly
* a god who is all powerful may not create the universe and simply create an experience for the self
* if god were supremely good, he would not permit deception occasionally the same way he would not permit deception all the time
* if god is not real: because being deceived is a mark of imperfection, the less powerful the creator is, the more probable the we are always deceived
* long-standing opinion may creep back if we are not alert
* pretend that all knowledge is false, with prejudices balanced, perceptions should be correct
	* no such thing as too much distrust
	* concentration on knowledge not action
* it is easy to fall back on false opinions and it takes energy to find real truth

## Meditation Two: Concerning the Nature of the Human Mind: That It Is Better Known Than the Body
* i think therefore i am
* the existence of the self does not depend on things it does not know of (objects of perception, the external world)
* nothing grasped by the means of the imagination pertains to the knowledge of the self
* thinks = doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills
* imagination although false, constitutes the self
* we do not understand objects through the imagination but perceive it through the mind alone
* perception of objects are an inspection on the part of the mind
	* instead of attributing the characteristics of an object to the object itself, we perceive through the judgement of these characteristics

## Meditation Three: Concerning God, That He Exists
* a person is a thing that thinks (doubts, affirms, denies, etc.)
* perception =/= truth
* things do not exist outside the self
* is god real and are they a deceiver?
* ideas cannot be false since although the form may be false, the idea itself is being imagined
	* chimeras are not real but the idea itself can be imagined
* will itself cannot be false as although we may choose to imagine false things, we still choose to do so
* ideas are not perceived external to the self
* although some aspects of reality are external to the will (pain, heat) they may not be external to the self as there may be some unknown faculty that produces these
* even if ideas proceeded externally, it does not necessarily mean that they resemble those things
	* sun drawn based on the senses vs sun based on astronomy
* substances are more objective reality than only modes of thought; ideas of a deity are more objective reality than substances
* something cannot come out of nothing
	* how can an effect get its reality if not from its cause; how can a cause give that reality unless it also possesses that reality
* some thing more perfect (which contains itself more reality) cannot come out of something less perfect (which contains itself less reality)
	* this is true for both formal reality and objective reality
		* formal: a stone cannot exist where it previously did not unless produced by something in which there is everything within the stone (conservation of mass, conservation of energy)
		* objective reality: if the stone does not exist, the idea of the stone must be placed by a cause with as much reality as the stone is conceived to be
* the nature of an idea is that itself does not need a formal reality but rather borrows from thought; this does not make it less real to formal reality
* an idea is not nothing and thus must get its reality from something
* an idea being described as objective reality does not mean that there is no need for the reality of these ideas to be formal, but only that it suffices for it to be in them objectively
* objective mode of thinking belongs to ideas, formal mode of thinking belongs to the causes of ideas
* although an idea can issue from another, infinite regress is not possible and will return to the first idea which contains all the reality
* ideas are like images that can easily fail to match the perfection of the subject, but can never contain something more perfect
* if the objective reality of any idea is found to be greater than the reality of the self, then the cause must be external to the self
* if there does not exist an idea which reality is greater than the self, then there is no argument for an existence other than the self
* formal falsity: the falsity of judgements on the perception of ideas
* material falsity: ideas that represent non-things as a thing
	* if cold is merely the absence of heat, then the representation of cold as something real and positive is false
	* does not need to have a cause distinct from the self since they proceed from nothing
	* as a result of the imperfect nature of the self
	* if true, then they exhibit so little reality indistinguishable from a non-thing, and thus can proceed from the self
* substance: a thing suitable for existing in itself
* since the self is a substance, clear and distinct ideas can be extracted (duration, extension, motion, shape, position) and applied to other substances
* god cannot exist form the self as it is infinite, independent, etc. and therefore necessarily exists
* the self cannot contain infinite substance
* perception of the infinite as the negation of finite as darkness is the negation of light
* recognizing the self as an imperfect being through comparison with a perfect being
* since god contains more objective reality than any other idea, then the idea has less basis for being false
* although you can pretend that god does not exist, you cannot deny the idea of a perfect being itself
* cannot fully grasp god as we are finite beings and cannot comprehend infinity
* perhaps the perfections of god are inherent of the self and does not yet assert themselves. achieve perfection through the gradual increase of knowledge
	* increase of knowledge is proof of imperfection
	* god is actually infinite and nothing can increase its perfection
* objective being of an idea cannot be produced by a potential being (which is nothing) but by an actual formal being
* if the self was brought upon by the self then it would be god as the self would make it perfect
* power to create is the same as the power to conserve
* regressing the cause of the self will end up with god
* god is a single entity because of preconceptions (????)
* parents only placed dispositions
* the idea of god is innate to the self
* it is impossible for the self to exist while having the idea of god unless god exists
* god is not a deceiver because fraud and deception depend on a defect

# Lecture
* post-renaissance
* French philosopher, mathematician, scientist; dubbed father of modern western philosophy
* god and the soul demonstrated through philosophy rather than theology
* medieval times church was in power
	* pope crowned the king
* René Descartes was afraid of committing blasphemy since he was starting to doubt god
* growing number of non-believers; effect of modernity
* Archimedean point; firm and immovable point
* fear of the question that throws you out of reality
* questions are destructive and creative
* questions are creative as it invites discourse; constant conversation

# Lecture
* imperfection of the self implies the existence of something perfect
* know that the self is imperfect due the standard of perfection
* the idea of perfection comes from a perfect being
* cannot deny the existence of perfection because cannot deny the existence of imperfection
* Freud: we dont always know what we are doing; consciousness is not an Archimedean point


infinite regress
* weve already figured out things we need or want to learn
* infinite regress hits a 180; you have not learned everything
* you build up everything and infinite regress takes everything from under you
* questioning until everything becomes meaningless
* beneficial until archimedian point is reached
* you get to learn more from infinite regress but is exhausting
