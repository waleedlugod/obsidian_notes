philosophy style of writing: dialogical writing
Linear writing: "moves in a straightforward idea from one idea to next, without examining (m)any supporting or contradicting ideas"; e.g. formal reports, scientific journal articles, textbook or encyclopedia entries
Dialogical writing: significantly considers other positions, especially opposing ones; intellectual honest demands the author to be fair and not misrepresent the opposition

cannot skim text, reread several times to understand what the author is claiming
"reading texts in philosophy well is also doing philosophy"
dialogical style: retrace steps in arriving to the authors conclusion

identify the central claim is half the battle
