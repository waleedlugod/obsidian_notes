# A Social Connection Model
Injustice implies responsibility, yet structural injustice has no clear culprit to blame.

Structural injustice is produced by millions of persons acting within institutional rules. The people who engage in immoral or illegal acts are not the only perpetrators of injustice.

Causal responsibility is not sufficient to find blame, but is often necessary.
It is necessary to connect a person's deeds linearly to the harm. The problem with structural injustice is that we cannot trace this kind of connection. However, it is not possible to identify how an entity has directly produced harm to other specific individuals.

>When housing consumers want big front lawns, for example, and developers cater to this desire, satisfying these desires arguably helps inflate housing prices in a region. It would be incorrect to say, however, that the actions of investors in a subdivision with big lawns or the buyers of the homes have themselves caused the difficulty some lower-income people have in finding housing for which they will pay less than 40 percent of their income.

The actions of people indirectly, collectively, and cumulatively produce structural constraints due to actions of privileged opportunities for some.

The social connection model: all those who contribute by their actions to structural process with some unjust outcomes share responsibility for the injustice.
One has an obligation to join with others who share responsibility to transform the structural processes. This is in contrast with the liability model.

## The Virtues and Limits of Liability
Standard liability: responsibility is assigned to agents whose actions are shown causally connected. These actions are shown to be voluntary and performed with knowledge of the situation.

Criminal and tort laws sometimes hold agents liable that depart from the standard liability e.g. culpable negligence.
Culpable negligence: an agent is responsible not because of their action, but failure of action that they are expected to take.

Strict liability: agent is liable for harm even if they are not the cause and did not intend or was unable to control the outcome.

Liability model: all practices under law and moral judgement of assigning responsibility. These are generally backward-looking in purpose.
In applying the liability model, clear rules of evidence should be present for demonstrating causal connection, evaluating intentions, motives, and consequence of actions.
The liability model in inappropriate for structural injustice.

Each agent moves on their own interest contributing structural injustice, yet none ought to be blamed.

The primary reason why the liability model cannot apply to structural injustice is that each agent acts according to normative practices, and it is in the nature of structural processes that harmful effects cannot be traced to one particular entity.

Cristopher Kutz: complicity in collective action requires that each agent intends; participatory intent. Participatory intent is not sufficient to cover structural injustice as these social processes lack the intent. In the absence of intent follows the absence of guilt.
Participatory intent falls under the liability model.

## The Social Connection Model
Ordinary language: responsibility refers to agents' carrying out activities in a morally appropriate way and seeing to it certain outcomes are obtained.
The social connection model: agents bear responsibility for structural injustice because they contribute by their actions to the processes that produce unjust outcomes. Each expects justice towards ourselves, and others can make claims of justice on us. All who dwell within the structures must take responsibility for remedying injustice, though none is liable for the harm.

### 1. Not Isolating
The purpose of finding guilt is to focus on what particular agents have done in their singularity. The liability model seeks to isolate those responsible from those not responsible. The purpose of this is to sanction or demand compensation from them alone.

An isolating concept of responsibility is inadequate in structural injustice. Finding some people guilty in contributing to certain outcomes does not absolve others from bearing responsibility.
Structural injustice may be ongoing even when actors have done nothing wrong in existing criminal, legal, or moral practices.

### 2. Judging Background Conditions
An actionable harm consists in a deviation from a normal set of background conditions. The process that brought out the harm is discrete, bounded event that breaks away from the normative flow. Punishment aims to restore normality.

A moral responsibility derived from structural injustice brings into question the morality of the background conditions we assume to be normal. We contribute to the reproduction of structural injustice because we follow its conventions.
Usually we act without the wider implications in consideration.
We often have reasons to believe that acting within these rules is virtuous, and it requires a deeper reflective view to understand how unjust outcomes are produced.
We have good reason to believe that alternatives are constrained by the same structure.

### 3. More Forward-Looking Than Backward-Looking
The liability and social connection model both refer to the past and future, but differ in emphasis and priority.
The primary purpose of the liability model is backward-looking. The harm we seek to hold agents responsible has reached a terminus.
The primary emphasis of the social connection model is forward-looking. We seek to assign responsibility that is ongoing and likely to persist. These circumstances has not reached a terminus. The point is not to compensate for the past, but to transform unjust outcomes.

### 4. Shared Responsibility
The social connection model does not isolate those liable that implicitly absolve others.
I bear responsibility in the awareness that others bear it with me.
I share the responsibility with others to transform these processes to reduce their injustice.

### 5. Discharged Only through Collective Action
Responsibility can be discharged only through collective action.
Structural injustice is a political responsibility in contrast to private moral or juridical. We must engage publicly with the sake of organizing our relationships most justly.
Although it is true that the best way for social organize is by state institutions, but these must be viewed as mediated instruments for coordinated action, rather than distinct actors independent of us. Government policy to promote social justice usually requires the active support of communities in order to be effective.

Those who share responsibility for structural injustice may make social change through collective action in civil society independent of the state.

Even victims of injustice nevertheless share responsibility for it. These actors should take the lead in organizing remedies as they are most acutely at stake. Their social positions also offer  unique understanding of the nature of problems.

## Resentment and Defensiveness in Politics
Politics motivated by shared responsibility to undermine injustice involves debates about alternatives, their implementations, and consequences. Blame-oriented language in these political discourse have limitations.
The language of blame impedes discussion that will end in collective action as it expresses resentment, produces defensiveness, or focuses more on the people than the circumstances that must be changed.

Slave morality: resentment; a complexity of inner life that turns outward in response to hurt; seeks to find the powerful agents that cause evil and try to exert a counterpower over these wrongdoers.
It is unrealistic and mean-spirited to seek equivalence for every harm. A spirit of resentment allows those who lay blame to wallow in the past. These feelings are unproductive where harms are a repeated product of structural social processes.

The blame language inappropriately divides people between wrongdoers and innocent, rendering most people passive and unable to help remedy the problem.
The discourse oversimplifies, inflating the power of some actions leaving many others ignored.

Blame also produces unproductive blame-switching.
It focuses the debate on the past, rather what can be currently changed.
It divides people, creating mistrust where cooperation is required.
It is impossible to address issues in a forward-looking way as we are waiting on who should pay for remedy.

Even when people admit they are to blame, it is unproductive as the focus is on themselves and their past actions rather than the core issue.

Solidarity does not require homogeneity or symmetry. [[Asymmetrical Reciprocity]]

>Solidarity is a relationship among separate and dissimilar actors who decide to stand together, for one another. Moreover, unlike brotherhood, which appeals to a natural origin in the unspoken mother, already there to be counted on, solidarity must always be *forged* and *reforged*. Solidarity is firm but fragile. It looks to the future because it must constantly be renewed.

People in solidarity aim to improve the well-being of themselves and/or others. They do not accept the past as determining the present and future. Existing social structures are possibilitiesâ€”perhaps things can be improved.
Let us try to alter structural injustice and perhaps we will have some success.
