# Death of the Author
* writing is destruction of every voice, every point of origin
* writing is neutral, composite, oblique space
* author is a modern figure a product of the middle ages

## The Author
* explanation of work sought in the person who produced it
* author is nothing more than the I
* to give a text an author is to impose a limit on the text
* everything is to be disentangled, nothing is deciphered

## Removal of the Author
* language speaks not the author
* removal of the author transforms the modern text
