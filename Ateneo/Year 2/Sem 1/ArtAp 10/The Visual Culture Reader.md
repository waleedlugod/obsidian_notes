# What is Visual Culture?
* visual culture is everyday life
* gap between wealth of visual experience and ability to analyze that observation
* visual culture: visual events in which information, meaning or pleasure is sought by the consumer in an interface with visual technology
* visual technology: apparatus designed either to be looked at or to enhance natural vision e.g. oil painting, television, internet

## Postmodernism is visual culture
* dominant postmodern style is a pastiche that finds comment and critique the only means of innovation
* postmodern: crisis caused by modernism and modern culture confronting the failure of its own strategy of visualizing; it is the visual crisis of culture not its textuality
* fascination of the visual and its effects was a key feature of modernism
* human experience is more visual and visualized than ever before
* visual culture is a tactic to analyze periods of time
* western culture used to value the spoken word over visual representations, but western philosophy and science now use a pictorial rather than textual model of the world
* the threatened dissolution of boundaries and oppositions is one of the fundamental conditions of modernity itself
* visual culture as a visual that is contested, debated, and transformed as a constantly challenging place of social interaction and definition in terms of class, gender, sexual, and racialized identities

## Visualizing
* new feature of visualization of things that are not visual
* visual culture examines why modern and postmodern culture values rendering experiences in a visual form
* the world picture meaning the world grasped and understood as a picture
* ancient and medieval times regarded as the world as a book
	* pictures were not representations but are closely related or identical to the object itself
	* For the Byzantine Church the icon *was* the saint it represented
* the modern period makes countless reproduction of imagery
* visualizing does not replace linguistic discourse but makes it more comprehensible, quicker, and more effective
* visual culture directs our attention away from formal viewing settings (cinema) to the visual experience of everyday life
* postmodernism marks an era for visualization with no clear goal in mind
* phenomenon of virtuality dominating actuality
	* films produced by "smart" bombs that showed targets being destroyed yet at the same time not being more accurate than standard bombs

## Everyday life
* visual culture is a tactic, in full view of the enemy i.e. society
* the (post)modern destruction of reality is accomplished in everyday life
* dismissal of photography's claim to represent the truth; one photograph no longer shows the truth
* soap opera is pure television because of its unrealistic staging not despite it
* visual offers immediacy that cannot be rivalled by print media
* the feeling of awe on first sight: the sublime
* the sublime by Immanuel Kant "a satisfaction mixed with horror"
* pleasure in reason exceeding all expectation; pain in the imagination proving inadequate to the concept
* sublime is to present the unpresentable
* experience of the sublime demands a sensitivity to ideas that are not natural but acquired through culture
* visual culture remains as a discourse of the West about the West
	* think of modernity not necessarily European but contingently so
* success or failure of visual culture hinges on its ability to think transculturally
