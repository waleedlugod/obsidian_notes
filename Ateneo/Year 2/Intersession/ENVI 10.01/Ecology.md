ecosystem: interaction between biotic and abiotic

methods:
* *in situ* observations
* controlled experiments
* modelling

natural systems are balanced systems

ecosystems are dynamic and shifting to attain balance
systems are capable of adapting

visible light = par Photosynthetically Active Radiation: used by plants for photosynthesis; only 1-10% used

Photosynthesis: light dependent reaction & light independent reaction (calvin cycle)
light dependent product: ATP & NADPH
calvin: carbohydrates

trophic levels:
1. producers/autotrophs
2. primary consumers
3. secondary consumers
4. tertiary consumers

types of energy
1. solar energy
2. chemical energy
3. kinetic energy
4. heat
