driver of hydrologic cycle: solar energy and gravity

ground water below water table

aquifer: underground caverns of porous layers of sand/gravel/bedrock
* unconfined: water seeps from above
* confined: layer of impermeable material above and below aquifer

watershed: area of land contributes water to a stream or river
* boundary is called drainage divide
* trees stabilize soil and hold water

water pollution: measured by biological, chemical, or physical criteria
* biological: fecal coliform
* chemical: nitrate, phosphates
* physical: sediments
* point sources: discharge pollutants at specific locations
* non-point sources: diffuse and cannot be traced to single site
* lotic: moving water
* lentic: static

groundwater
* flows slowly
* non-degradable wastes can take thousands of years to decompose and be removed - permanent pollutants
