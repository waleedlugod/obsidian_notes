ecological succession: transition in species composition in a community
* primary succession: environments where there is no soil
	* lichens and weathering aid in formation of soil
	* organisms add organic nutrients to soil
	* climax community: final stage of succession remaining unchanged until a disaster
	* pioneer species --> intermediate species --> climax community
* secondary succession: pre-existing soil
	* initiated by event that drastically change the climax community

biomes: area according to plants and animals in it
* dictated by abiotic factors

general climate zones
* polar: at least 60 degrees north/south
* temperate: 23.5 - 60
* tropical: 0 - 23.5
biomes
* terrestrial: characterized by temperature and precipitation
	* tundra: low shrubby mat-like vegetation at high latitudes: permafrost
	* taiga: boreal forest; primary conifers: long thin needles, thick waxy cuticles, sub-surface stomata
	* desert / dunes: < 30cm per year precipitation and unpredicted rainfall
	* savannah: scattered trees; seasonal rainfall
	* grassland: dominated by grass
	* rainforest: high tempreature, heavy rainfall, high humidity, 200 - 450 cm precipitation
	* ice caps: large body of ice
* aquatic: wawa
	* ponds & lakes
		* littoral zone
		* limnetic zone
		* photic
		* euphotic
	* river & streams: moving water bodies
	* estuaries: end of river where they meet the sea; very productive
	* ocean:

biodiversity: totality of species on earth and the ecosystem where they thrive
levels:
* genetic diversity: variation of genes within species
* species diversity: abundance of species
* ecosystem: variety of ecosystems
