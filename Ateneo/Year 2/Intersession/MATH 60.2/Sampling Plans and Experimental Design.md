sampling: process of selecting elements from a population to study and generalize result to the population
random selection
* each member has a known change to be included
* everyone is selected by chance
* bias reduced
non-probabilistic sampling
* may/may not be representative of the population

simple random sample: a sample where the selection is random

observational study :data existed before observation

1-in-k systematic random sample: random selection of the first k elements, then selection of every kth element thereafter

strata: subpopulation with similar characteristics
stratified random sampling: simple random sample from each of the strata

cluster: groups containing several elements
cluster sample: random sample of entire cluster

#### non-probabilistic sampling
convenience sample: easily obtained without random selection
judgment sampling: decided by sampler
quota sampling: sample must reflect the population based on preselected characteristic, has nonrandom component in the selection process

undercoverage: excluding certain segments of population
wording bias: question that are too complicated/confuse the reader/sensitive in nature
