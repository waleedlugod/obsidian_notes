parameters: numerical descriptive measures that describe a population
* population mean
* population standard deviation
* binomial proportion

inferences about population parameters
* estimation: predicting the value
* hypothesis testing: decision about value based on preconceived idea about its value might be

types of estimators: formula how to calculate an estimate based on information from the sample
1. point estimation: a single value 
2. interval estimation: range of values where the parameter is expected to lie

### point estimation
good characteristics for estimator
* unbiased: sample distribution of point estimator should be centered over value of parameter
* small spread of sampling distribution of estimator

confidence coefficient: probability that a confidence interval will contain estimated parameter
*  1-a; 95%:confidence coefficient 5%:a
* a is maximum probability willing to commit an error

error of estimation: distance between estimate and true value
