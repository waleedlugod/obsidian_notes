population size | number of individuals in the population
population density | number of individuals in an area
population growth | size of population changing over time<br/>affected by population density:<li>density-dependent factor e.g. predation</li><li>density-independent factor e.g. drought</li>
age structure | composition of population in terms of individuals of different ages<br/>affected by:<li>education</li><li>birth control programs</li><li>quality of medical services</li>
life span | how long an individual lives
fecundity | how much an individual contribute to the population
carrying capacity | maximum population an environment can hold

#### Why study population growth?
* better predictions about future changes
* understand causes to population size and growth rates
* insight into how organisms interact with each other and environment

density-dependent factor: predation
density-independent factor: drought

#### why is the population growing
* advances in medicine, agriculture, science

see equation for birth rate etc in slides

#### ecological footprint
measure of amount of resources a person consumes including energy required to dispose of waste
carbon footprint: amount of carbon dioxide emissions of a person
