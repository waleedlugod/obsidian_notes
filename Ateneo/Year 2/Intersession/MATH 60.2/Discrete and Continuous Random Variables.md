random variable | the value it assumes, corresponding to the outcome of an experiment, is a chance or random event
probability distribution | for a discrete random variable is a formula, table, or graph that gives all possible values

requirements of discrete probability distribution
1. 0 <= p(x) <= 1
2. Σp(x) = 1

### mean for discrete random variable
see slides page 20

population mean = expected value = E(x)

u(mew) = E(x) = Σ(xp(x))




### individual vs cumulative discrete probabilities
individual discrete probability: probability that the discrete random variable takes on a exact value
cumulative discrete probability: probability that the discrete random variable takes on a range of values from 0 to n
