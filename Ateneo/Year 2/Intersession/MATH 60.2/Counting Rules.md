### mn rule
multiple the amount of simple events for each stage in a experiment to get all possible outcomes

### permutations
order matters

Combinations | Permutation
-- | --
AB | BA
AC | CA
BC | CB
n distinct objects
r at a time
Pnr = n! / (n-r)!

example 4.13
50 * 49 * 48 = 117600

P503 = 50!/(50-3)!

### combination
if order does not matter
Cnr = n! / r!(n-r)!

B.
3C2 * 4C1 = 12 ways

1.
a.  8C3 = 56; 8 * 8 * 8  = 512 
b. 8P3 = 336; 8 * 7 * 6 = 336

2.
subjects: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4! = 24
math: 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
physics: 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
history: 2 * 1 = 2
language: 1
totality: 24 * 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 6912

### addition
A and B are mutually exclusive events
the number of ways A can occur is denoted as n(A) or |A|
E is an event in which either A or B occurs
n(E) = n(A) + n(B)


1.7C6=7
2.7C4 * 8C2 = 980
3.8C3 * 7C3 + 8C4 * 7C2 + 8C5 * 7C1 + 8C6 * 7C0 = 3850
