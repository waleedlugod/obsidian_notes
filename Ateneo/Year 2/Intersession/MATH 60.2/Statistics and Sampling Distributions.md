statistics: measures the describe the sample
sampling distributions: the probability distributions for statistics
* what value of the statistic can occur
* how often each value occurs

ways to find the sampling distribution of a statistics
1. drive the distribution mathematically
2. use a simulation; tabulate results in relative frequency histogram
3. statistical theorems

### central limit theorem
central limit theorem sums and means tend to have a normal distribution
standard error: stddev/sqrt(n)

when the sampe size is large enough to use clt
* if sample population is normal, the sampling distribution of mean is also noraml
* sampled population is symmetric
* sampled population is skewed: sample size n must be at least 30


#### sampling distribution of sample mean
z = (xbar - mew)/sigma sqrt(n)
