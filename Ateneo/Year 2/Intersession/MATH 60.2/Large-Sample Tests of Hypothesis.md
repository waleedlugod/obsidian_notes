statistical test of hypothesis, defines a particular test
1. null hypothesis, denoted by H0, hypothesis of no difference, contains = in some form
2. alternative hypothesis, denoted by Ha
3. the significance level and the rejection region
	1. no directional difference = two-tailed
	2. directional difference = one-tailed
	3. region of rejection: values that support Ha
	4. acceptance region: values that support H0
5. test statistic and its p-value
	1. alpha = maximum tolerable risk
	2. p-value: actual risk of falsely rejecting H0
	3. p-value < alpha: reject H0; p-value = alpha: reject H0; p-value > alpha: do not reject H0
6. conclusion
	1. reject null hypothesis: results statistically significant
	2. statistically significant: what has been observed in the sample can be observed in the population

draws one of two conclusion:
1. reject H0 and conclude that Ha is true
	2. sufficient evidence
2. do not reject H0
	1. not enough evidence

no directional difference = two-tailed
directional difference = one-tailed


type 1 error: reject H0 when it is true; alpha
type 2 error: do no reject H0 when it is false: beta

p-value = normsdist(z)
