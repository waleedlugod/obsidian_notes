union denoted by A u B
intersection A n B
complement A'; A does not occur

### union
P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AnB)
to avoid duplicate of AnB; both AUB and AnB contains the intersection AnB

### intersection
two events are independent if and only if the probably of B is not influenced by A and vice versa
when rolling a dice twice:
* A rolling a 2 & B rolling a 2
* P(B given that A occured) = 1/6; P(B | A)
* P(B given that A did not occur) = 2/6
if dependent:
P(AnB) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B)
