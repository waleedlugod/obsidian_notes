Difference between truth as relative and truth as subjective.
Relative has not absolute, not open to intersubjectivity.
Subjective has absolute but depend son the perception of the subject, open to intersubjectivity.

truth of Science: objective and verifiable (knowable)
Truth of Religion: subjective and non-verifiable (believable)

Ultimate Truth is a relation but not a subject-object relation but a subject-subject relation.
Only  subject can respect the subjectivity of the other.

Objective reflection: truth becomes an object, the point is to disregard the knowing subject (the individual)
Subjective reflection: truth becomes personal, the point is to immerse oneself in this subjectivity

Objective reflection turns the individual into something accidental.
The subject and subjectivity becomes unimportant, objective validity is paramount.
Solely subjective definition of truth make lunacy and truth indistinguishable.
Absence of inwardness is also lunacy.

One cannot forge an authentic relationship with an object. Either one will manipulate or be manipulated.
Always a one-way relation.

Technology as concretization of an objective truth like a program or a mechanical construct.
Technology is blind. It only recognizes you according to its own parameters.
Technology is a best friend if you conform to its demands, and worst enemy if you do not conform.

Truth as subjectivity which is uncertain comes with life commitment and passion.
We become passionate with something uncertain and impossible.
One cannot be passionate with the objective, with a God-idea or an idol. One cannot love an object.
"In mathematical proposition, absolute objectivity is given but of that reason its truth is an indifferent truth and it concerns me very little."

Inwardness and the "ethico-religious sphere" of Truth
If one believes in the immortality of the soul three things must be south out from him Kierkegaard says: "If he risks his entire life, he has the courage to meet death, and he has the passion for the infinite so determined the pattern of his life that it must be found acceptable - if there is an immortality."
Truth is validated by the commitment of the individual subject.
Commitment is only possible with a Truth that is not objective (believe-ability, you only have the choice of belief for uncertain truths)

Passion for the infinite means that you can commit your entire life to it. That which you commit your entire life to is an "uncertain". When it becomes certain, it becomes also an object. In this case , there is no need of life commitment or "passion for the infinite".
Commitment is "Passion for the infinite". There is no commitment with something finite, static and unchanging.
"Thus, the subject merely has, objectively, the uncertainty; but it is this which precisely increase the tension of that infinite passion which constitutes his inwardness."

Ultimate Truth
"A 'objective uncertainty' (paradox) held fast in an appropriation process of the most passionate inwardness is the Truth, the highest truth attainable for an existing individual."
No Truth without a passionate subject.

The truth is precisely the venture which chooses an objective uncertainty with the passion of the infinite.
I contemplate the order of nature int he hope of finding God, and I see omnipotence and wisdom; but I also see much else that **disturbs my mind and excites anxiety**. The sum of all this is an object uncertainty. But it is for this reason that the inwardness becomes as intense as it is, for it embraces this *objective uncertainty* with the entire passion for the infinite.

Connection between Truth and Faith
A truth that is certain is no longer truth but a mere idea of 
Truth is an equivalent expression of faith (only believable). Without risk there is no faith. Faith his precisely the contradiction between the infinite passion of the individual inwardness and the objective uncertainty.
If I am capable of grasping God objectively, I do not believe, but precisely because I cannot do this I must believe. If I want to keep myself in faith, I must continually see to it that I hold fast to the objective uncertainty.

For Kierkegard, subjective truth is the best Truth we could have. Our search for truth will not end for we are but limited receptacle.
The search for it is what counts, and what makes our life and existence meaningful. It is not the arrival but the journey that matters.

Five Characteristics of the Ultimate Truth
1. Truth is not an object which can be known
2. Truth cannot be comprehended/known; it can only be loved. (limitation of agnosticism. Since it can not be known it is not worth pursuing)
3. Truth is Subject/Person
4. Truth is a paradox (objectively uncertain)
5. Truth requires belief since its incomprehensible and can't be objectified.
