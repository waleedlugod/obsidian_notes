The phenomenon of Religion is "too big for reason" (Fideism-Subjective aspect) to grasp; however, it is not impossible to have a "wholistic view or summary" (Rationalism-Objective aspect) of it
Religious belief should be assessed as a rounded whole rather than taken in stark isolation.
It is the synthesis of fideism and rationalism.

Cumulative case argument
Even if Religious truth is too big for reason to grasp, we can still have an acceptable image of the truth. Image is not reality but something close to reality. If one cannot have the entire truth at least one can have an image of it.
By gathering all bits and pieces and put them together in one coherent whole.

The different pieces of evidence take in isolation are defective, but taken together they reinforce one another and add up to a substantial case.

Subscribes to Kant's inability to know reality as a whole
But can have in image of reality

Even though religious truth is beyond out grasp, we cannot say everything is acceptable because we can have a closer image of it.
One can evaluate which faith is fake (no rational basis) and which is credible (has rational basis)

There is a psychological, scientific, natural and rational explanation but insufficient (reading inspiring books can make one very religious)
Supernatural explanation cannot have the monopoly of explanation because it ca be explained rationally albeit insufficient.

Soft Rationalism promises to have a capability in having an image of what is true and real.
This is through cumulative Case Argument

There is a need to believe in Soft Rationalism.
Religion according to Soft Rationalism is not entirely rational.
Also called soft Fideism.
One needs faith but one needs reason also because religion has to be rational because of its static dimension.

Problems and Objections to Soft Rationalism
1. World views are complex and dynamic. It is not easy to specify their content. It is very difficult to specify what they mean.
2. There is subjective element or personal bias in judging something as rational and irrational.
	1. There is a danger of personal whim, bias, emotional involvement, and other non-rational factors adversely influencing the weighing of evidence.
	2. Total dependence on intuition could be dangerous
3. The process of weighing the rationality of word views is thoroughly circular
	1. One has to know the world view first to judge which of the pieces of information are valid.
	2. In order to judge its rationality, one must be deeply committed with a particular worldview or rationality.

Implications of Soft Rationalism and Soft Fideism to Religion
On assessment of religious validity
All religions are not the same in terms of rationality
Some religions are superior in terms of rationality
Atheism not applicable

Saint vs "Strongman"
The saint is superior (non-resistance) than the strongman (aggressive)
Just like a religion that treats everybody with equal dignity and value is superior than the religion which treats other people to be interior then the others because the latter will always end up with exploitation, discrimination and violence. Such kind of society will not stand.
A religion that promotes violence is inferior to that which promotes non-violence.

Religion is both rational/objective (static) and subjective (dynamic)
We need in religion both Ethics of belief and the Will to believe.
