to hope is to risk

Either God exists or does not exist
Pascal's wager is a genuine option in relation to William James

Pascal's Wager: god is not demonstrable
from the inability to prove both God's existence and non-existence
is belief in God legitimate?

life is a wager
Life is like a game of chance and our only choice is to play or wager. Refusal to play means forfeiting our chance to win and it is something impractical and unreasonable to do. It is an outright loss. The most reasonable option is to play.
For Pascal, however, we are not so unfortunate because there is a smart way to play or wager.

how to play and wager smart?
Here are the possible outcomes. In any case, there is always an equal chance of winning and losing.
You wager on God's existence and He does exist. You win
You wager on God's non-existence and He does not exist. You win.
You wager of God's existence but He does not. You lose
You wager on God's non-existence and He does not exist. You lose.

Two kinds of losers
1. He who wagers on God's existence but God does not actually exist
2. He who wagers on God's non-existence but god indeed exists

Two kinds of winners
1. Those who wager on God's existence and God indeed exists (the infinite)
2. Those who wager on God's non-existence and God indeed does not exist (the finite, you will die anyway)

What kind of winner
With God's existence, the prize is eternity and infinity of joy, while with God's non-existence, you only gain this finite world with its heart aches and pain. And it is not worth comparing to the eternity of life in heaven.
To be a smart player, one must choose that which guarantees bigger and higher price considering the odds are the same

What kind of loser
Choose God's existence because when you lose you lose only your sacrifices and pains in your piety and good works which are actually not a loss because psychology says altruistic people are generally happy and at peace even though their goodness are not reciprocated. Time and energy spent for authentic virtuous activities build up the individual.
However, when you wager on God's in-existence and God exists, you lose everything including this world and the eternity to come. You gain very little in living as if there is no afterlife.

What does it mean for God to exist and God not to exist
Moral Implication: unconditional acts of goodness and Virtue
belief in God is inseparable from a life of virtue

Rien ou L'infini
Choosing God's existence means: you gain everything or the infinite
However, choosing God's in-existence means you gain nothing if you win because this world contains only everything that is passing and ephemeral. And if you lose, you lose the infinite joy and satisfaction

Why it is about hope?
Let go of the prey for its shadow
They prey's shadow is more valuable and worthwhile than the prey itself. It is madness for many and it is a scandal for some because in hoping one prefers the uncertain over the tangible. One disregards the sensible joy (self-satisfaction) of this world for the infinite joy which is but mere shadow.
It is not delayed gratification
Hope is a negation or saying no. You say no to what is palpable because you believe in the intangible. Preferring the absent (intangible) rather than what is present (calculable). Only those who have the experience of the intangible/ the other can hope. (Religious experience)

A Tale of Winter a film by Rohmer
Felicy, Charles, Maxence
Felicy has to wager and take the risk in waiting for Charles whose return is bleak and uncertain
Felicy lets go of the prey for its shadow. Like an unbelieving unbeliever/negative moment of unbelief she says no to the false image with a firm belief that a true one exists. He sets aside what is tangible for something intangible which is absent and whose coming can never be certain
Felicy risks and wagers for something which is uncertain and absent. She then believes. She the hopes
This is related to Marcel that hoping/believing s something religious and irrational for you let go of the prey for its shadow
