our understanding of goodness and omnipotence not appropriate for God

options: atheism
atheism: provides nothing to suffering
Christianity: God suffers with humanity (the cross), evil doers will be judged

Religion, Salvation (Hope), and Communion
1. Without need for salvation (presence of a finite and imperfect world/experience of evil), there will be no religion
2. Without Religion, there will be no communion: Only religion can make communion/fraternity of all people possible
3. Without communion there will be no salvation (Hope of Life after Death)
religion: static - divisive; dynamic - inclusive
