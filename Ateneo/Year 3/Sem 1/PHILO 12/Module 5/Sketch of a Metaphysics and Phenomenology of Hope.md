Part 1
The acknowledgement of the presence of an other
Hope is above all a recognition of an "other who is greater than myself" (the Irreducible of Marion, the objective uncertainty of Kierkegaard, the Beyond Being of Plato)
If this other is equal to me,  I can ignore him and live by myself alone. If this other is inferior, I can reduce his existence according to what I like. This is tantamount to a solitary existence. I need to choose whether I live alone or with an Other
Hope beings when my solitary existence ends

Difference between I Hope and I Hope That
The best expression of true hoping is the former as the latter has connotation of selfish wishful thinking

Hope arises in situation of weakness: I am not in control (Fertile grounds for hoping)
Trial (I am in difficult situation)
Deprivation (I do not have what I need, I am not complete)
Captivity (I am in prison)
Invalidity (I am incapable)
Absence of people who hold us dear (I am alone and abandoned)

Hope can blossom in a non-tragic situation
Experience of an expectant mother. Arrival of someone dear

Difference between hope and optimism
Optimism remains still in the province of the "I, myself"
Optimism is "ego-logical." It is about a capable and  control ego.
Optimism and Pessimism are the same. They are two faces of the same coin. Two faces of "egology." Two ways of looking at the facts and data. One can't be optimistic with a person. One can only hope.
The difference between conviction (pessimism and optimism) and belief in Marcel

The truth is that there can strictly speaking be no hope except when the temptation to despair exists. Hope is the act by which this temptation is actively victoriously overcome.
There is a kind of hopelessness in hope. In the absence of such hopelessness, hope is not possible. (against the capable ego or egology)

Hope "coincides with the spiritual principle itself" (It does not need a material support)
Hope cannot be quenched by material or physical deprivation because it is by nature related to something spiritual. Experience of suffering can ignite hope

What is despair?
Capitulate and Accept
To capitulate, the the strongest sense of the word, is not only, perhaps is not all, to accept the given sentence or even to recognize the inevitable as such, it is to go to pieces under this sentence, to disarm before the inevitable
To accept, on the contrary, can mean to hold on and to keep firm hold of onself, that is to say to safeguard one's integrity. Because I am condemned never to recover from this illness, or not to come out of this prison I do not mean to give up, I do not consent, from this very moment, to be the useless creature which my illness or my captivity may finally make of me; I will counter the fascination which the idea of this creature might have for me with the firm determination to remain what I am.

Acceptance means:
Resistance against the sentence imposed
Refusal of the verdict (characteristic of Stoicism but the stoic is always imprisoned of himself) the greatest degree of sublimation of the "I, myself"

Hope is beyond acceptance (recapitulation) or safe guarding one's inner (integrity)
It is positive non-acceptance and it is different from revolt (non-acceptance)

Concentration of the self on the self
The essence of which is probably a certain impatience
If we introduce the element of patience into non-acceptance (which is positive) we at once come very nearer to hope

Hope and being patient
Patience involves a combination of acceptance of a non-self or external. I no longer need to be patient if everything can be subsumed to my powers and according to what I wish. Be patient means, wait because things do not necessarily happen according to you plans expectations
In a society totally governed by technology, which is Ego's intensification, there is no room for patience.

"Taking ones time" decenters the ego
To take one's time is not to be in a hurry. To be in a hurry is to subject things according to my project. In a hurry is a kind of impatience. One must respects the external rhythm and one must not rush as if everything is for me (pour soi and en soi)
Rebellion (negative aspect/selfish) is a kind of impatience and non-acceptance of what is given. It means not taking ones time.

To take one's time. He who rebels and stiffens does not know how to take his time. To rebel or to refuse is to become stiff vice versa
There is a secret affinity between hope and relaxation. To relax is to let go and abandon, waive ego's desire for power and control.

The analogy of the Bamboo
Hope means first accepting the trial as an integral part of the self, but while so doing it considers it as destined to be absorbed and transmuted by the inner workings of certain creative process

Part 2
Hope vis-a-vis despair/disapointment
in despair, the self becomes the center yet incapable
in disappointment, things do not come as the self has envisioned or expected

Connection between liberty and hope
The example of the invalid: one hopes to be cured at a particular time. one can still hope even the time set for recovery has lapsed
Because one is no longer subject to two opposing possibilities
Freedom is the capacity to rise beyond the available possibilities (to be cured or not to be cured, to win or lose)

method of surmounting
Here hope appears to be bound up with the use of a method of surmounting, by which thought rises above the imaginings and formulations upon which it had at first been tempted to depend

fear as instinct of self-preservation (ego)
My existence is threatened and in danger so i fear.
Those who truly live are those who are no longer afraid to die

Love imposes expectations (parable of the talents)
To love anybody is to expect something from him... To expect is in some way to give: but the opposite is none the less true; no longer to expect is to strike with sterility the being from whom more is expected, it is then in some way to deprive him or take, from him in advance what is surely a certain possibility of inventing or creating

hope therefore is a kind of trade
It gives and receives. There is dynamism and vitality.
Marcel speaks of action. Without superior object in view means that it is all for myself. I am alone. Hope in this way is set aside.

Hope is recreating and innovating
In hope there is recreation: one accepts and at the same time aspires to recreate and innovate what is received: but there is a limit to what we can change because if we can change things at will, it is tantamount to total refusal or non-acceptance.
I accept nothing of the world means I can recreate it at will. This is not hoping because, in this way, the world will become all about what I want of it.

Hope and its temporal dimension
Time is not something divided into fragments like seconds, minutes, hour, etc. Rather it is a continuous and unbroken reality. The future and the past are one interconnected with the present. Remove past and the future and we have a static presence. It can't move forward.

Temporal dimension of despair
Despair is a consciousness of a kind of time which is closed resembling a prison cell. Everything is determined and foreseen. Tomorrow is the exact consequence of today as in a logical sequence. It is, thus, predictable (Marcel's notion of conviction). There is no room for hoping. One must not expect for something new to come.

Avenir vs Future
In despair, the present has no future because the future is determined by and contained in the present.
In despair, there is no way out because the future will be exactly the same as the present.
Avenir literally mean "to come." Future is mere extension of the present. It is predictable because it based on the "calculation of possibilities."
The present then has nothing to do with the past and the future. There is no room for gratitude and surprises.

"Memory of the future"
We might say again that if time is in its essence a separation and as it were a perpetual splitting up of the self in relation to itself, hope on the contrary aims at reunion, at recollection, at reconciliation: in that way, and that way alone, it might be called a memory of the future.

Anxiety for truth
I think, to introduce the idea of a certain human condition which we cannot hope to transcend by thought, for reflection shows that in trying to rise above it we make it unreal and impoverish it.
Perhaps we should see in the human condition a certain vital and spiritual order which we cannot violate without exposing ourselves to the loss not only of our equilibrium, but even of our integrity.

Part 3
Hope and risk
Like believing and loving, hoping is inseparable with risking
Avoidance of risk is avoidance of disappointment which is another form of "egology." Disappointment is chaining reality down in advance. It seeks to align everything according to what I like and expect.
We tend to personify the experience which has failed to fulfill our expectations. I counted on such a thing happening: it did not happen.

Hope is like receiving a gift
A gift is something not dictated or chosen by the receiver. Hoping does not impose a particular outcome
It is permissible to consider the analogous situation of a being who is awaiting a gift or favor from another being but only on the grounds of his liberality, and that he is the first to protest that the favor he is asking is a grace, that is to say the exact opposite of an obligation.

Degradation of the understanding of hope
"To hope in" becomes "to expect from" then "to have due to me," that is to say "to count on" and to finally "to claim" or "to demand."

Critique of democracy as mercenary of hope
Democracy as "my right" oriented
To be quite fair it must however be noted that democracy, considered not in its principles but in its actual achievements, has helped in the most baleful manner to encourage claiming in all its aspects, the demanding of rights and indeed to bring a mercenary spirit into all human relationships
Exclusion of disinterested service and mistrust of others

Hope and communion
Hope is always associated with a communion, no matter how interior it may be. This is actually so true that one wonders if despair and solitude are not at bottom necessarily identical.

Communion and hopes as remedy to
Systematized empiricism
Rights oriented democracy
Tyranny of obsession: "I see a being so much the less the more I am obsessed by him, for my obsession tends to substitute itself for him"
Subjectivism/Individualism: "we becomes strangers to ourselves, in so far as we treat the reality as something which can be won and placed at our disposal."
Collectivism (impersonal, no respect of the individual)

I hope in thee for us
The best formula of hope and communion: "I hope in thee for us"
The "Thou" guarantees communion among us. It binds the whole into one. Without the Thou everything will turn out be among and according to us.

Having vs Being
Having is contrary to hope. Hope can penetrate the armor of having (I/security/control). To have is to prioritize security and control
Being is light and fluid and creative. Having is heavy, systematized, stagnant
In this sense it is no doubt true that, strictly speaking, only those beings who are entirely free from the shackles of ownership in all its forms are able to know the divine lightheartedness of life, in hope. But, as far as we can judge, this liberation, this exemption, must remain the privilege of a very small number of chosen souls.

Hope is ambivalent
It depends upon me and it does not depend upon me. It is both capacity to receive and capacity to refuse/resist (Acceptance and Refusal, Capitulation and Acceptance, Ability and inability). It is a play or dance between the subject which is capable and free and an objective reality which cannot be obliterated at will.
In the region of philosophic reflection, however, it seems as thought it is equally true, and consequently equally false, to say that hope depend or does not depend upon me.

Positive non-acceptance means that my refusal or non-acceptance affirms an independence and liberty inherent in my subjectivity but it is positive at the same time because this attitude of non-acceptance points to a reality which one cannot violate save to recreate.
The act of recreating something given is a sign of positive non-acceptance

The world/life as gift
A Gift is not just simply received. It mus recreated. When I recreate it, I respond to it as gift demands for a response/acknowledgement

Hope is irrational/impractical
Can one hope when the reasons for so doing are insufficient or even completely lacking?
Yes. Hope is "irrational" like love and faith. A mother hoping for the return of his son who was certainly killed in the war.

General analysis: Why sketch, metaphysics and phenomenology?
This article is about sketch which is different from blueprint.
Sketch means that it does not give us the full image. It is a partial image because hope is a human/religious experience about a non-objectifiable reality. People hope because there is something to hope for (Is this something that one hopes for an illusion or reality?). It has phenomenological element as it portrays the interplay of the subject and the mind-independent reality.
