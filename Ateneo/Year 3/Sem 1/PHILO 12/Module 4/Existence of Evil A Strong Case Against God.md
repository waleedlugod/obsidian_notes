Notion of evil only through experience of pain and suffering

Three distinct characters
1. demea: who believes that the presence of pain and suffering is necessary to the evolution of man's goodness
2. cleanthes: who as an experimental theist, denies the existence of man's misery and wickedness in favor of substantiating the goodness of God
3. philo: who represents Hume's belief wherein pain, suffering and evil simply cannot logically and evidentially exist in a world created by an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God

Concrete existence of evil
David Hume puts forward a strong case against God's existence by capitalizing on the concrete existence of evil. He argues that evil is palpable in every corner of the earth and its existence one finds it hard to ignore.

The presence of evil is then a strong case against God who is omnipotent and benevolent.

A malevolent and impotent God
He recycled Epicurus old question regarding the all-powerful and benevolent God that if He is truly magnanimous and omnipotent he should prevent all sorts of suffering and pain from happening
"Is he willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he able and willing whence then evil?"

Against St. Augustine's claim
If life is good why is it that life is but of pain and misery. And if there is sweetness in life, this will be far outweighed by bitterness. Life is but pain and sorrow.

According to Hume
All the goods of life united would not make a very happy man, but all the ills united would make a wretched indeed... that the greatest propensities which he had ever enjoyed had been mixed with so many adversities that he might truly say he had never enjoyed any satisfaction or contentment.
