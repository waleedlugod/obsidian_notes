Saint Augustine

Evil has no actual existence
It's existence is provisional or accidental. Ex. Darkness to Light
Chance passenger analogy
Evil is like a parasite. It can exist so long as its host exists
There can never be evil without the good

Evil as human responsibility and not God's
Evil is a human phenomenon (Existential approach). Animals do not have notion of evil.
It begins with the fall of man according to the Bible (Book of Genesis)
The misuse of free will leads to the corruption of the good.
It is like a dormant entity activated by human irresponsibility and failure.

God should not be blamed.
Human beings are responsible for the sufferings and evil in this world.
Hannah Arendt's Banality of Evil is about human responsibility and culpability. Man chose not to exercise his freedom/freewill by just following orders. It is in this human disposition that evil has had its way says Arendt.

Natural Evil and Human Responsibility

Evil can be overcome: a possibility
Jesus Christ self-offering on the cross
Man should turn away from selfishness
Humanity should begin living not for themselves but for others
Love as self-sacrifice has been the greatest enemy of evil. I believe that love will prevail. Teilhard de Chardin considers love as a spiritual energy at it is already at work in man. It is perfected in Jesus Christ that's why He is considered as the summit of evolution.

Bergson talks bout the evolution of consciousness in his book Two Sources of Morality and Religion from being self-centered to being other-oriented
From self preservation (natural) to self-offering (supernatural)

Human being as culpable yet capable
Human being is the summit of evolution:the natural (self-preservation)  is overcome by the supernatural (love and self-giving for others)
In lovign one becomes a god/divine
Pierre Tielhard de Chardin: man as a loving being. Capable of loving others.
