Arguments for God's existence by Thomas Aquinas

Objections against God's existence
1. Existence of evil
2. Reductionism: everything can be reduced to some natural, material and human principles.
	1. Everything material can be traced to nature; and everything voluntary can be traced to human will.
	2. Sacred Scriptures says the God exists.
	3. The existence of God which is a revealed truth is not irrational.
	4. Aquinas does not defend God's existence but how this revealed truth is not adverse to reason.

Arguments from motion, causality and necessary being
The first three arguments have the same principle.
Motion is self-evident.
Aquinas concludes that there must be an unmoved Mover who has triggered all the movements.
Since the cause of all movements can be attributed to no one, it will regress infinitely.
The absence of form or finality is absurdity because everything will turn out to be partial and provisional.
Rationalism does not give room for absurdity, and absurdity will only have its way when there is no Ultimate Cause.
Infinite regress which takes place in the absence of Ultimate cause is absurdity.

Qualities of the unmoved mover
1. Causa Sui / self-caused: ti must not have a cause other than itself.
2. Ultimate cause as a perfect being: must contain in itself all the perfection needed; there is nothing can be added to or deducted from a perfect being.
3. Unmoved mover is a pure act or in state of pure actuality.

3. The possible and necessary being
The possible being can exist or not exist.
The necessary being is one which another being depends on it.
Necessary beings may have a cause but the unmoved Mover is an exception.

4. Graduation of things
Nature is in different levels and intensity.
God is the highest and perfect Being.
Without the Highest our hearts we will have no anchor and will remain forever restless.

5. Intelligent design
In the universe there is design and order.
Whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end, unless directed by some being endowed with intelligence.
Related to the concept of contingency.

Response to objections
1. Since God is the highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil.
2. Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.

The universe cannot be a mere accident.
Life as absurd is not acceptable.
