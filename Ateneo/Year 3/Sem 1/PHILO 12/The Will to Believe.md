"It is wrong always to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."
One risks falling into paranoia.
To what extent can we allow objectivity?

What is a genuine option:
1. Living or dead option
2. Forced or avoidable option
3. Momentous or trivial option
A living option matters and is meaningful.
Avoidable allows other options than one presented.
Forced is a binary option; a choice must be made and cannot be avoided.
Momentous happens only once in a lifetime.

Choose a genuine options even without being 100% certain.

The option is not Genuine. We can forgo gaining the truth and save ourselves from believing in falsehood, by not making up our minds at all till objective evidence has come.
But if it is Genuine; meaning it s a matter of life and death, one needs to have a will to believe.

Clifford's ethics of belief does not work when an option is genuine
There is not point in delaying your decision.
Genuine option is something which you cannot avoid. By avoiding to decide whether you will study in college or not is tantamount in choosing to not study.

For William James: it is paramount importance to know the truth than committing error. Committing error is secondary (daring)
For William Clifford: it is paramount importance not to commit error rather than discovering the truth. Knowing the truth is secondary (segurista)

The will to believe involves risk leaping into the unknown.
In only starting will you know if you are successful.

Clifford: Believe nothing, keep your mind in suspense forever, rather than closing it on insufficient evidence incur the awful risk of believing lies.
James: Clifford  exhortation is like a general exhorting his soldiers that it is better to keep out of battle forever than to risk a single wound.

" When I look at the religious question as it really puts itself to concrete mean, and when I think of all the possibilities which both practically and theoretically it involves, then this command that we shall put a stopper on our hearts, instincts, and courage, and wait — acting of course meanwhile more or less as if religion were not true — till doomsday, or till such time as our intellect and senses working together may have raked in evidence enough — this command I say, seems to me the queerest idol ever manufactured in philosophic cave."

William James reduced religious truth to scientific truth which is verifiable (reduced dynamic to static)

William James: belief, passion, intuition, optimism, discovering the truth, daring, faith
William Clifford: certainty, intellect, logic, pessimism, avoiding error, segurista, reason
