# What is religion
Religion means following a dogma or doctrine.

# Religion vs Religious
One can be religious without subscribing to a particular religion.
Being religious is when there is a reference to a higher being.

# Philosophy of Religion vs Theology
Both take God and religions as their subjects.
In theology, atheism is not an option in discussions.
Theology assumes God already exists, and discuss how to practice this belief.

Philosophers take all arguments into account.
Everything is questioned.

# Two Dimensions of religion: Static and the Dynamic
*Dynamic* is the experience of the divine or *religious experience*.
William James defines *religious experience* as the feeling acts and experience of individual man so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relations to whatever they may consider "Divine".
Divine is something irrational and unexplainable, but not everything unusual is necessarily religious experience.
Divine ‚üπ irrational.

Religious experience is a matter of personal conviction.
To take an experience as religious means that the experiencers believe that a naturalistic explanation of the experience is insufficient, and can only be explained through divine terms.
Religious experience is the root of religion.
Because of the unexplainable, we believe in religion.

Divine is something unmeasurable and unexplainable. It creates wonder. Mystical.

The *static* dimension are the *doctrines*, *moral codes*, and *rituals*.
The static arises from the experience of the divine.

Religion without religious experience will not continue.
Without the dynamic dimension, the static will have no roots.
Without the static dimension, the dynamic will not be articulated and shard.
The static is the visible, the dynamic is the invisible.

# Etymology of Religion
Relegare: to bind together.
Relegire: to see again or reread.
Because religion is an articulation of the divine, it is imperfect.

# Is Religious experience tantamount to God's existence.
Not simply prayer.
Experience in the presence of the divine.

Characteristics:
1. Ineffible
2. Noetic: receive knowledge not available through human experience
3. Transient
4. Passive: controlled by superior power

Characteristic ext.:
1. The Unitary consciousness
2. Nonspatial, nontemporal
3. Sense of objectivity or reality: mystics claim to be able to achieve a state of in which self-awareness and awareness of objects cease e.g. nirvana
4. Blessedness and peace
5. Feeling of the sacred
6. Paradoxicality
7. Ineffability

Types:
1. Public ordinary: exists in public that is completely ordinary
2. Public extraordinary: witness miracle
3. Private describable
4. Private non-describable: cannot explain in normal language
5. Non-specific experience: without mediation by sensory object

Numinous experience: feeling the presence of something greater

Principle of credulity: believe unless proven false.
Principle of testimony: people generally will tell the truth.

Freud believed religious experiences are illusions.
Projecting their innermost desires and fears.

Corporate experience: group of people at the same time

Arguments:
1. Lack of vocabulary
	1. mystical experience is ineffable
	2. some ordinary phenomena are also ineffable
	3. Christian mystical tradition (mysticism) has a well developed vocabulary
2. Subjective
	1. ineffability and noetic quality is subjective
	2. God can never be part of the phenomenology because interpretation is needed.
3. Interpretation according to doctrinal or faith tradition
	1. experiences may be subjectively the same but differently reported because of different faith tradition of the individual
	2. religious experience cannot be described apart from their belief system
4. Epistemological unattainable
	1. Kantianism: Kant on the impossibility of attaining knowledge
	2. It is beyond our capacity to know reality itself
5. Product of dramaturgical and narcissistic tendency

Reaction to the objections:
1. There is a common core to religious experience
	1. transcends the boundaries of different religions
	2. Mystical experience has a common denominator despite beliefs
	3. interpretation through the use of symbols is for the sake of communicating and does not alter the substance of the experience
2. If believers thought that their religious experience lacked ultimate reference (noetic and objective bases) then it may be doubted whether they would be adequately motivated to live religiously
	1. one does not risk their life for something they have no knowledge
3. Arrogant presumption that what the philosopher cannot know cannot be real
4. Test religious experience by their translation to actions of love and lively existence
	1. No one will put their life on the line for something inauthentic

Material dimension
A sense of "mineness" in structures.
Like a home, the design of the material dimension may be unknown but not arbitrary.
Domus Dei: house of God; must invoke grandeur
domus ecclesiae: house of community

Kohak's notions of the religious resonance of the "concept of contingency" and "sphere of mineness"
Concept of contingency points towards an other greater than oneself.
When we say thank you we recognize the other.
Sphere of "mineness" implies a sense of order, even if unknown.

Where there is order there is a sense of divine presence.
Order is not proof but reason to believe.

Objection to material dimension as an experience of God's presence
Is God actually present or is it the grandeur that makes one believe God is present?
Is grandeur tantamount of God's presence.

---
Emotion gives religious import to our experience.
A machine devoid of emotion will not arrive at an assumption pertaining to the religious.

God is revealed in the feeling of wonderment.

Thought vs feeling
1. Thought conditions our feelings e.g. remembering an unpleasant experience
	1. Feeling has thought content so it is a mediated and indirect apprehension of the real
	2. Emotion can be redirected by thought but also links us to the realm of the real
2. Feeling is more primordial than thought
	1. Emotion has unmediated link to reality. It is unprocessed by thought. Thought merely direction emotion because of social and teleological concerns.
	2. Sailboat: wind = reality; rudder = thought
	3. Joy and surprise is not a product of thought
	4. Thought is not primordial as it arrives late in evolution
	5. Thought is both an asset and a liability
	6. Religious experience is a feeling not an intellectual experience

The artist and the mystics are able to feel total dependence from the source of power that is distinct from the world.

Can religious experience justify religious belief?
Inconclusive.
Cannot verify through science since it is not material.

Freud: religious experience as yearning for a father figure
Marx: religious experience as opium for people

"If the ability to know God is an illusion, it is a very widespread illusion."
The mystics are to a great extent consistent of what they learn through their experiences.
These accounts have the "prima facie" claim.

"We are not entitled to ignore what they say because we find their persons uncongenial, or their manner of life unattractive." C.H. Whitely

Religious experience admit a degree of inter-personal confirmation.
It is personal but not isolated.
