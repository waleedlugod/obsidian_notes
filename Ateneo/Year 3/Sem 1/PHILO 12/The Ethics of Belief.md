Main argument: it is wrong always for everyone to believe anything upon insufficient evidence

They should be counted as person whose judgement was to distrusted and should not be looked upon as honorable men. For although they had sincere convictions, instead of being honestly earned by patient inquiring they listen to the voice of prejudice an passion.

To the accusers who represent believers without sufficient evidence.
Dont jump into conclusion before examining the evidence on both sides.
Faith is not just saying yes without questioning

Beliefs can have impacts on others. Misinformation is harmful and unethical.
Dont believe something that is not rationally justified.

Rationalism:
* Cannot leave everything to providence
* Control your passion and impulsiveness
* Must have sufficient evidence
* Open to doubt and further investigation
* "It has been judged wrong to believe on insufficient evidence, or to nourish belief  by suppressing doubts and avoiding investigation."

One's belief ha social consequences.

To what extent can we allow persona conviction to have its way?
Should a person refuse a blood transfusion if blood is sacred and forbidden.
Such harmful belief can be imitated by other people and can be passed on to the next generations of believers.

"Every time we let ourselves believe for unworthy reasons, we weaken our powers of self-control, of doubting, of judicially and fairly weighing evidence. We all suffer severely enough from the maintenance and support of false beliefs and the fatally wrong actions which they lead to. And the evil born when one such belief is entertained is great and wide"

The life of a man who is not open for discussion is a crime against humanity.

Tyranny and Dictatorship takes place due to unjustified credulity which he calls stupidity. Many have become victims of stupidity.
