"Of that which we cannot speak, must we remain silent?"

The "Sound of Silence" and Idolatry
talking without speaking
hearing without listening
writing songs that voices never shared
neon god they have made

an idol is always a false image but an image is not necessarily an idol
an idol is a complete reduction of God to an idea, concept, object or entity while image is not.
An image captures god partially as it contains element of reality
There are images of God that are not harmful and dangerous. God as tower of strength, refuge of the sick and the poor, bastion of justice, defender of the oppressed
With respect to images of God though, we need relégare

Idol is a God objectified, the dynamic becoming completely static
Idolatry is about me rather than about God. It is about a god that man has created to fit his purpose.
In idolatry one reduces god who is irreducible to a concpet or an idea or a particular object
For marion, God can only exist as an idol

Should there be something like a "God"?
The answer is No-thing

Being and existence can be considered as idolatry
God infinitely surpasses the categories of being and existence
"God is" or "God exists" is more bout us rather than about God. It is us who determine what is and what is not. "What is/exist" refers only to what our mind can grasp.

Saying "I believe in God" or "I do not believe in God" doesn't say anything about God, but only more about myself.
So nothing, de jure, can be  said decisively about "God" except this: when it comes to the matter of "God," conclusions concerning "God" do not belong to him, but to the one who thinks him.

The problem of evil via à vis idolatrous notion about God
Reducing God to a concept allows man to use God to his advantage i.e. exonerate himself from culpability
Evil is a problem for God because we think of God as omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omnipresent being.
That being said, he should prevent sufferings from happening because it runs contrary to his nature as omnibenevolent where in fact, we understand omnibenevolence from our point of view.

Bracketing God's existence
Existence is one of the idolatrous ideas we have of God and so we need to bracket God's existence
Two reasons: "First, because (as we have seen) it is not self-evident to attribute existence to "God," as it proves to be either useless in its univocity, or unintelligible in its equivocity. And then second, because the lack of existence (the negative existence) is often required in the order to think "God" as God."

This means that there is more to God than existence/being

God as "Irreducible" is not idolatry
Because irreducible upholds God's mysterious character unlike existence and being. It does not pretend to capture God in a concept.
Irreducible suspends any predicate about God which is man-made.
If it is therefore possible to prove that we can reduce everything to idolatries and if, in this case, there remains something to be said, the it remains reasonable to name God "irreducible."

To dream the Impossible; To reach the unreachable
IN irreducible: God is always in the domain of the impossible, the unreachable
For man it is impossible. The impossible is beyond mans' domination and control
The Irreducible is no longer of man but of God as God
