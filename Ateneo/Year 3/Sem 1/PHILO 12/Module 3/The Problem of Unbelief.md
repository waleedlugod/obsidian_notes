Belief without unbelief and vice versa: possible?
It is a problematic term. There are many kinds of unbelief.
What do you mean by atheism?
When you talk about God, is it about false images or about the true, living and ineffable God.
The two terms are inseparable: there is a belief in an unbelief an in an unbelief, a kind of belief.
A negation is an affirmation.

"The fact is, however, that there never was an age in which unbelief did not manifest itself in one form or another so much so that the problem of unbelief has always been inseparable from the fact of belief."

On unbelief and false images of God
Understanding unbelief from the notion of false Gods

Some false/problematic images of God
* The Spiritual God of the Neo-Platonist: a God totally separated from the world
* The Lord of Host
* The God of Armies and the avenging God of the Hebrews
* God as Constantinian Impertor/medieval "Lord": God granting favors and privileges to loyal subjects seen as a wish-granting entity towards certain "holy acts"
* God as a threat to human freedom
* Explanatory God of the 18th and 19th century
* 20th century God that blesses nuclear weapons

3 different kinds of unbelief
1. unbelief of the unbeliever
	1. is unbelief justified? in what way is it justified?
	2. This kind of unbelief is triggered by the existence of false images of God
	3. Saying no (unbelief) means saying yes (belief) to something. Negation is affirmation
	4. agnostics and atheists: God as an idea or concept (non-belief: one does not have reason to believe)
	5. anti-theism or atheistic humanism: God as hindrance or obstacle to human freedom and flourishing. Sartre and Nietzsche: (anti-belief: one has positive reason not to believe)
	6. unbelief or disbelief could be a more religious attitude than belief because it is about non-acceptance of false god
	7. Socrates was condemned by his own generation for being an atheist. His atheism, however, was directed to false gods in the city.
	8. Both Jesus and Socrates were rebels against smug faith (worship of false gods)
	9. Feuerbach: "The Atheism of today is the religion of tomorrow."
	10. A god who rejects the value of this world by making eternal life as the only true goal of life is a false notion of God Nietzsche. In this way, disbelief is a more religious attitude than believing.
	11. A god who must guarantee his people comfortable life, who will solve all their problems and take away all their sufferings is a false god. He is an opium of the people.
2. the unbelief of the believer
	1. worship of false images of God. One can't commit to this god because it is false; serving this kind of god will lead to a devastating consequence
	2. Ex
		1. smug faith: worship of an inauthentic God
		2. Faith without commitment
	3. smug faith is the worst form of believing
	4. a god who is pleased in the killing of the people who do not believe in him is a false an inauthentic god
	5. Catholic faith was not entirely perfect an unblemished. There were times in history that she believed in a wrong god, a god who gave a green light to the Inquisition
	6. Christianity, though imperfect, is a true worship because we also offer ourselves an not just only secure favor from God says Lauer
	7. If the believer does not accept what true faith implies, his belief is at the same time a non-belief
	8. belief is not only a matter of verbal confession, it is measured by one's commitment to human advancement
	9. Commitment to God is meaningless without commitment of man. It is not also because in loving man, we love God but is because man is lovable and in not loving man we become less human
	10. It is not our task to safeguard the interest of God, he cant take care of himself but our task is to safeguard the rights of man ever against he intolerable demands of the legalistic god which we ourselves have fashioned
3. negative moment of unbelief (the living faith)
	1. a sort of atheism or unbelief is encouraged here to strengthen and purify one's belief from false gods
	2. the role of rationalism in religion (Like Clifford's ethics of Belief and Mariel Lucenio's Losing my Religion)
	3. It is both rejection of the worship of the false images God and affirmation that God exists yet He is unknowable, mystical, ineffable, unreachable which the unbelieving unbeliever would not dare to entertain
	4. Combination of rationalism (rejection of false images) and fideism (recognition of God's ineffability)
	5. Living faith or negative moment of unbelief is both believing and unbelieving at the same time.
	6. rejection of certitude/certainty about God
	7. Negative moment of unbelief means that God is not according to what we know of him. We can be certain of God in terms of what He is not rather than what he is for us.
	8. Combination of Belief and Unbelief: Believer in relation to a true, living and ineffable God and Unbeliever in relation to a false God
