Opinion
1. Opinion deals with something that one does not know
	1. A person saying something about playing piano but does not know how to play the piano and the dynamics of music
2. An opinion is self-centered point of view: it is not open to questions and further discussions.
3. Opinion has false basis: it arises from false knowledge of something
	1. Eating grapes causes diabetes and God is just an idea or concept. Here, one has a false basis in one's knowledge of diabetes and God.
4. Absence of commitment from the one saying it.
	1. Kierkegaard's notion of passion and faith.

"I was recently prompted to say a few words to an audience composed entirely of communists or at least persons inspired by communism. I found it possible to refrain from uttering any words which would offend the audience. But while I also felt a certain basic sympathy of my audience, I at the same time recognized how completely impossible it was to reach them on the level of opinion."

Conviction
1. Distinction between closed and opened reality by Henri Bergson
2. Closed is measurable (objective: the whole is the sum of all its parts). One cannot add to or subtract from. Nothing new can enter. It is ready-made. It does not hide anything more than what it shows. The future is already contained in the present.
3. Opened (immeasurable, intangible/indivisible: the whole is more than the sum of all its parts) it hides itself behind what is shows.
4. Objective certainty is attainable in closed realities. It arises from knowledge about something objective and verifiable; it can be supported by facts and data.

Belief
1. Belief is knowledge about something which is intangible, immeasurable, and unverifiable and about something objectively uncertain.
2. Belief is temporally inverse with regard to conviction. Time is predictable in conviction (The future is in the present. Commitment not meaningful) while time is unpredictable in belief (The future is not yet known in the present. Commitment is meaningful)
3. Unlike conviction, there is room for commitment in belief, because it deals with opened reality.
4. Entering into a relationship of trust and love with someone is Believing
5. Experience of betrayal and disappointment is  only possible with a person and  not with a system or tangible object. Political system does not betray; politicians do. One does not have faith in science but with the scientist.
6. Love and faith are inseparable. To love the other is to believe in that other with the risk of being betrayed. Love can't bloom in certainty and risk-free relationship. Trust in the other is love.

Important Questions
1. "I think that the moon is made of blue cheese." Conviction
2. Opinion is always about tangible and objective things. No
3. Why atheism is problematic? It is because the best we could have atheism is an opinion (false basis and lack of knowledge) or it will become contradictory.
4. Problem of Evil and opinion. The problem arises from a wrong understanding of God as an omnipotent Being. If God is omnipotent, why does not act to remove suffering?
