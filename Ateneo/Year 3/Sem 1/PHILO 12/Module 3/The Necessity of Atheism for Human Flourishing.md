atheism as the more rational choise

age of anthropocene
suddenly stabilized after ice age, holocene; became stabilized for human beings
more civilizations emerged during the holocene

century ago, humans shaped the world
climate change

western civilizations realized humans could use know the world that they can step back from it (abstraction)
systems of understanding that reflects how the mind works and how it manipulates the world

the anthropos in the anthropocene: reason, autonomy, and power

if we define the world (age of homo deus), what is the value of the gods of faith
the gods were the children of ignorance and need

long ago, we believed everything existed with a spirit, and everything was equal
some spirits had special knowledge (animism)
gods did not care about us

from agriculture, we realized that we have power of nature
some spirits have the power to make things be and happen (god)
god of palay, god of terraces

realization of overarching order that rule over the gods, determined by one powerful god (monotheism)
science explained the order but in terms of human understanding and reason instead of nature

we have discovered that we are free and autonomous, and our human flourishing is dependent on us embracing all of that
absurdity: nothing means anything
embrace absurdity = embrace freedom
humans are gods

there is no god but the human
it means accepting that we are the giver of meaning and shape our purpose to the universe
but it also means accepting that there is no one to save us but ourselves and no better existence than what we give ourselves

so it seems that atheism is the most reasonable position for a contemporary person if we want to realize our human flourishing
faith in gods is a counter evolutionary or developmental position

and yet the world is filled with people of faith
atheism is a worthy critique of faith which opens a way for homo deus to move forward
but we must also be critical of it because it is rooted in a very particular conception of humanity and human flourishing

are we really flourshing
atheism has it presumptions too
stilted towards a kind of flourishing that western civilization has imposed through globalization

science enables us not to become dependent on God or supernatural power
science leads us to atheism because science makes us capable. It enables us to create. A god who provides is no longer needed as it is obsolete

Does not Science promote a form of theism?
Progress ins Science is the reason behind the rise of monotheism
Science just substitutes God with an equation or formula to explain the ultimate reality of the whole universe. Science is theism: God as overarching scientific principles/equation
In a deeper sense, science is not different from Theology (Static Religion) Metaphysics (Philosophy) in creating idolatrous image of God.
