*Information* is knowledge that reduces uncertainty.
Mapping from number to meaning must be specified.
If you can't map information, then computation is impossible.
Information can be represented by the a number.

information in digits
A = ceil(log10(n/m))
n = possibilities before info
m = possibilities after info

information in bits
A = ceil(log2(n/m))
