Why haven't CPU clock speeds increased?
Size limitations, power limitations, work limitations
Transistor counts still rising.
Clock speed, power, and instructions per clock tick reaching limits.

Machines moved from a long assembly line with quick stages to parallel assembly lines with slower stages.
High-frequency machines are performant but not energy efficient.

Limitations:
1. Clock speed of microprocessors
	1. Speed of single microprocessors have not increased since 2003
2. Operating voltage of chips
	1. Unable to lower operating voltage power requirement since 2005
3. Instruction-level parallelism
	1. Hardware cannot remove dependencies in code execution
Heat is the common issue.
Heat removal is extremely difficult for smaller chips with high transistor density.

Performance gains approaches:
1. Hyperthreading
2. Multicore
3. Cache
