Structured data are facts.
Unstructured data are photos, videos, maps, etc.

Data can be random and confusing.
Information is data in context.

Metadata describe the characteristics of end-user data and the context of that data.
Metadata is data about the data.

A database system is composed of:
* the data stored
* the DBMS
* the software
* the hardware
* the people

Software include the DMBS, CASE tools, applications software and utilities, user interface, etc.
People include database administrators, system developers, programmers, etc.

File systems disadvantages:
* Program-data dependence
* Data redundancy
* Data inconsistency
* Limited data sharing
* Lengthy development times

Database systems advantages:
* Program-data independence
* Minimal data redundancy
* Improved data consistency
* Improved data sharing
* Increased productivity
* Enforcement of standards
* Improved data quality
* Improved data accessibility and responsiveness
* Reduced program maintenance
* Improved decision support

Database systems limitations:
* Specialized personnel
* Installation and management costs and complexity
* Conversion costs
* Need for explicit backup and recovery
* Organization conflict

Features of a DBMS:
* Cross-entity linking mechanism
* Data dictionary
	* contains metadata; also known as system catalog
* Query language
* Mechanisms for data access
	* protect data integrity and privacy by controlling actions that users can perform
* Host language interface
	* allows database commands to be combined with standard programming language commands
* Data manipulation language
* 4GL development software
	* visual interface software
* Disaster recovery
	* software that provides mechanism to recover damaged data and control concurrent access
	* concurrent access: the simultaneous access by multiple users

# Data models
Conceptual methods of structuring data
1. Hierarchical: relationships structured as hierarchies; uses pointer-based retrieval
2. Network: organized as arbitrary graphs; uses pointer-based retrieval
3. Relational: collection of tables; links data with a common element
4. Object-oriented
