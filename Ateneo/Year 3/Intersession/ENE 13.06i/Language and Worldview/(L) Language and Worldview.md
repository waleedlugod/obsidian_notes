Language refers to meaning-making tools we use to communicate.
Figurative language is the use of language in ways that deviate from their literal meaning.
Literal meaning refers to the precise definition or denotation of words.

Both literary and ordinary discourse use figurative language, but tends to be more intensive and creative in literature.

Figures of speech are part of the system of language we use everyday.
Language does not passively reflect reality; language actively creates reality.

Language can both include and exclude people, and it is oftentimes very related to ideology.
All language have ways of distinguishing between "them" and "us." This desire leads to words for the other" acquiring explicitly negative connotations.
We need to not only call out those who explicitly use negative language to "other" people, but also those who unintentionally do so.

Ideology is a system of values based on prejudices and cultural and social assumptions.
Stories are not impartial but political tools which shape the world and are shaped by it.
Ideology is about looking at exploitation not as an obvious exercise of violence but as something that is subtly ingrained into our consciousness by the cultural texts we consume.
