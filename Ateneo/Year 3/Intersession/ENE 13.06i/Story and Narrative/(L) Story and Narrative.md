Narrative = Story + Plot + Discourse
Story: what is told.
Plot: why is it told.
Discourse: how is it told.

Narrative have become dangerous in the post-truth society where alternative-fact narratives and appeals to emotion and beliefs weight more significantly in convincing people.

Contradictions:
Suggest ideas vs perpetuate the status quo and oppression.
Shape understanding vs fake news and disinformation.
Lend a voice vs silencing in the fact of the establishment.
Provide a language of telling stories vs marginalization of other narratives.
Let you image the possibilities of existence vs self possibilities of existence and disregard for the community.
