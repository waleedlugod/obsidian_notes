## Todorov's Equilibrium Theory
Equilibrium: the first state where the world begins
Disruption: de-balances the equilibrium
Recognition: characters realize that there is a problem
Repair: Protagonists embark to fix the disruption
New equilibrium: new status quo; linear in nature and told in chronological order

## Strauss' Binary Opposition
Humans assign meaning to our world by dividing it into two distinct categories.
Humans structure their world through understanding it in relation to one another.

Binary opposition has the tendency to promote the othering of people.
Humans craft their identities based on their group allegiances.
Humans do not possess singular identities. Our stories cannot be divided into simple binary oppositions.
