Narratives are found all around us in different modes.
Narrative is a political activity that define the world around us and how we experience it.
Narratives education, inform, and persuade.

The "narrative turn" of the 60s and 70s argued that the human impulse to generate narratives offers insights into the working of our minds.

# Narrativity
Most theorists base their definition of a narrative on events.

Marie-Laure Ryan argues narrative is an "invariant core of meaning" which she calls the traditionalist view.
Monika Fludernik argues that narrativisation is more of a reading strategy than formal properties of a text.

Ryan conceives narratives as a medium-free "cognitive construct."
She also allows for different modes of narrativity, including a spectrum from simple to complex.
Narrativity may also be understood differently with respect to visual narratives, whether working together or in opposition.

Narrativity may be understood as a condition for humanity.
It is crucial to how we make sense of random things and experiences in our daily lives.

In the constructivist view of narrative, stories do not just happen, but are made.
The stories available to us are shaped by our culture.
Narrative imitates life, and life imitates narrative.

# Narrative and the Mind
Cognitive narratology argues that narrative forms can offer insights into complex psychological states.
Stories provide us with scripts that help up navigate our experiences.

# The End of Narrative and Non-Narratives
Strawson contends that there are good ways to live that are deeply non-Narrative.
He claims that the preoccupation with narrativity is potentially dangerous for those who feel that their lives do not fit the narrative model.

Other critiques argue for the importance of other forms of recording experience.

In narratology, "unnarratable" refers to events that are either trivial or taboo.
"Disnarrated" refers to what does not happen such as a character's hopes and dreams that are never achieved.

# Narrative Across Media and Culture
New technology reinforce the idea that humans will always seek out and tell stories.
Narrative theory becomes useful with media convergence, where the same story is told across various media.
Postclassical narratology challenges the rigid tendencies of narratives of the past towards exploring new ways of thinking about narratives.

# Key Terms
Story is the chronological sequence of events of a narrative.

Plot is the shaping of the story into a logical structure which shows connection between events. A plot provides reasoning or motivation for events.

Characters are participants in the world depicted by the narrative. Often, characters are only interesting insofar as they help drive the action. Characters may also be narrators for embedded narratives told to other characters, or the main narrative voice in the case of a first person narrator.

Narration is the telling of the story. Controversy exists in narrative theory whether the narrator is an entity or not.

Storyworld is the setting where the action of the narrative takes place. Storyworld may also refer to the mental models readers create as they interpret narratives.

Narratology are types of systematic models for narrative which can be universally applied. Postclassical narratology moves away from quasiscientific approaches to focus more on context and to embrace new perspectives. Other examples are feminist narratoloyg and cognitive narratology. Postclassical narratology engages in dialogue with postmodernism, poststructuralism and postcolonialism. It also shifts its focus away from the formal properties of text and towards how people respond to stories.
