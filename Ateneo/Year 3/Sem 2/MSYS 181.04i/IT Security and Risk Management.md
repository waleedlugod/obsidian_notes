Information security
Protection of information and its critical elements
* physical offices
* network
* software
* hardware

Pillars of information security
* computer security (hardware and software)
* data security
* network security

Characteristics that give value to information
* confidentiality
* integrity
* availability

Information security triad
Confidentiality: protection of an asset from improper disclosure
Integrity: ensuring the accuracy, precision and trustworthiness of both information and information systems processing
Availability: ensuring that all components of information systems (data, network, systems, hardware, people, process) are accessible when needed

Purpose: protect the information needed by the organization to conduct its business
CIA + authentication + non-repudiation

Confidentiality
Supports the principle of "least privilege" by providing that only authorized individuals, processes, or systems should have access to information on a *need-to-know-basis*
Level of access necessary
Public, private, confidential

Information security vs IT security
its: protect any information: digital, physical, intellectual
IT: use of technology to protect information; protect infrastructure: hardware, software, network

IT security vs cyber security
IT: boarder area; internal and external
cyber security: networks and system; external

All three use CIA. Require similar foundational knowledge. Physical and digital access control.

Security established by policies, procedures, behaviors, risk management, and controls
Prevention: ensuring security incidents don't occur
Detection: rapidly and reliably detecting incidents
Correction: recovering from incidents
