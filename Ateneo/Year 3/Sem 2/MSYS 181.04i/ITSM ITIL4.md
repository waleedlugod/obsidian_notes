Service provider: organizations who deliver services
Service consumer: those to whom services are delivered

Service consumer roles;
* users: use services
* customers: defined requirements for services and take responsibility for outcomes
* sponsors: authorize the budget for service consumption

Four dimensions of service management (resources):
* organizations & people
